Overall, this is a project that is set to be number one on the Billboard charts. Fans are liking it so far, and while there are a few detractors, many are just happy to have some new Nicki music. Having said all of that, there is a lot of nostalgia right now for Nicki's old stuff. For instance, her 2010 album Pink Friday is getting a whole lot of love. Furthermore, <a href=# rel>Nicki is teasing the return of her Alter Ego Roman, </a>which means we have to show love to the song that started it all, "Roman's Revenge."</p><p>"Roman's Revenge" is a song that certainly sticks out on Pink Friday. The album is a mixture of pop and rap that made a huge splash on the industry. As far as this song is concerned, Nicki cooked up something truly different for the time. The production is off-the-wall and her flows are out there. Furthermore, she goes bar for bar with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Eminem</a>, which is no easy task. Unfortunately, the song is plagued by some awfully outdated bars from Em, but the track remains iconic, regardless.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Nicki Minaj Praises The "Barbie" Movie</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicki-minaj-x-eminem>Nicki Minaj x Eminem</h2></span><p>With this song, Nicki showcased just how talented she is as an MC.
