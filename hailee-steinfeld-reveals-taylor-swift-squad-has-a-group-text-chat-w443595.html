But it’s so much fun to stay in contact and find each other along the way and all get caught up.”</p><p>The <i>True Grit </i>actress (who was nominated for an Oscar at 15) added that social media appearances may make it seem like the gang gets together more often than they actually do — and that’s not the only appearance that is deceiving.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>“When we are all together it does feel like a big reunion, and it normally happens to be when we are all dressed up and look a lot nicer than we normally do, so it looks a lot cooler than it is,” she said.</span></p><p>Steinfeld added that it’s helpful to have pals who are in the industry and understand the demands of being on the go all the time. “It’s nice to have people that get what it is that you’re doing,” she added. “I went through a period of time when some of my friends didn’t understand that what I was doing was more important than calling them back. So it’s nice to now have someone that understands and does the same thing that you’re doing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>The actress’ praise for Swift’s squad comes amid </span><a href=#>another pop star’s criticism of the all-girl power group</a><span>. In the new issue of </span><i>Glamour</i><span><i>,</i></span><b><a href=#> Demi Lovato</a></b><span> slammed Swift, 26, for curating a set of women who represent unattainable standards of beauty.</span></p><p>“It’s not realistic,” she told the magazine. “And I think that having a song and a video about tearing <b>Katy Perry</b> down [2015’s ‘Bad Blood’], that’s not women’s empowerment. We all do things that aren’t but I have to ask myself, ‘Am I content with calling myself a feminist?’ Yes, because I speak out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lovato, 24, previously criticized the “Wildest Dreams” singer in February for donating $250,000 to <b><a href=#>Kesha</a></b> during her sexual assault case against music producer<b> Dr. Luke</b> instead of taking “something to Capitol Hill.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmZmhsqZ50q2coqaWmrmledGerZ6ZnKh6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjKyorpmUYrWiv4yaZKCqn6q9bsDEsatmm5iWwW7Dk21qbnFlZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
