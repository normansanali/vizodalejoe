One of which is just how many mechanics it involves. This is made even tougher by how little the game actually tells you about the mechanics, instead letting the player figure it out for themselves. This means that even relatively simple stuff can be hard to figure out. So, with that in mind we have a few short, quick guides for these simple things, just to give you a heads up as to what you need to do. Therefore, here’s our guide on how to jump in Dark Souls 3.</p><p>We’ll assume that you are using a controller, as the PC keyboard and mouse controls are definitely not the preferred method of play for most. So, to start your jump you’ll need a decent amount of room. This is because you will need to be dashing, or running to perform the action. Back away from whatever ledge or object you wish to jump on/to/from and hold B or O to start your run.</p><p>Once you hit the right point you will click in the left thumbstick, this is what actually performs the jump action. Your character should leap into the air a decent amount. However, this is not a platformer, so don’t expect to be hopping on top of objects. Instead, the jump should be used to get some distance off of ledges most of the time. It can also help you when you are trying to run away, and avoid attacks.</p><p>For more tips and tricks in Dark Souls 3 you can head over to our thorough <a href=#>Beginners Guide</a>. It will break down a lot more of the simpler stuff in the game, giving you a head start against the undead forces.
