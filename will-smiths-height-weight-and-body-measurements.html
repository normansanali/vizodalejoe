First of all can we mention we didn’t see him coming he always hit us like a ‘William’ but he’s a topic for another day.</span></p><p>Today we’re going to check out his stats whether it’s Will Smith or Willard in one way or another if you’re consistently on the ‘richest 40’ list of the forty richest Americans. Fortune Magazine’s rich under 40, you’ll be on everyone’s radar.&nbsp;So without further ado, lets dive in.</p><h2><span>Will Smith’s Height</span></h2><p><span>At first glance, our dear Willard is quite the big guy.&nbsp;This first look is not misleading, Will Smith has been visited by the gods of height.&nbsp;It doesn’t matter if you know the exact numbers or not, we’ll tell you anyway.&nbsp;The actor stands tall at 6ft 2in.</span></p><p><span>You know what’s crazy and cool at the same time?&nbsp;His wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, is one foot shorter than Will.&nbsp;For their part, their children try to follow in their father’s footsteps as well as their “biology” allows.</span></p><p><span>Does Will Smith’s height have a role to play in how he’s cast in Hollywood?&nbsp;You bet however versatile he is, Smith lives up to what he has become as a hero, a man in uniform, a man of authority and the list goes on.&nbsp;Recently, the actor has taken on more serious roles, but the majority of the roles he portrays are typical “big guy” roles.</span></p><p><span>Celebrities who share Will Smith’s height are, Arnold Schwarzenegger (according to Arnold Schwarzenegger), Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and, surprisingly, Chris Brown.&nbsp;Besides Smith’s height, he has other distinguishing features;&nbsp;The actor has dark brown eyes, black hair, and ears that people have nicknamed “Dumbo’s ears.”&nbsp;Nevertheless, the actor owned it.</span></p><p><span>More recently, there has been speculation that unlike Will Smith’s height, his ears have been cosmetically altered.&nbsp;Rumors have been reported, but Will has never spoken about it and we doubt he will.</span></p><p><span>See also: Height, weight and body measurements of Arnold Schwarzenegger</span></p><h2><span>Will Smith’s Weight</span></h2><p><span>Willard’s weight is a pretty juicy topic.&nbsp;Like most actors and actresses in Hollywood, it’s not strange to add a few pounds or drop a few for a movie role.&nbsp;Be that as it may, the actor maintained his good “shape” for a long time.</span></p><p><span>He looks ripped when he needs to and toned when he needs to.&nbsp;In the movie ‘Ali,’ the actor got bigger and built more muscle, while he lost weight for his role in ‘I am Legend’ and his recent movie ‘Suicide Squad,’ Will went the extra mile and featured an eight-pack, because six-pack is so much last season.</span></p><p><span>The actor currently weighs 82kg which is pretty amazing given his height and build.&nbsp;As they often say here, it doesn’t happen overnight, again the dynamic duo of “hard work” and “compromise” has to come into play. The actor undergoes intense workout routines throughout his week, combining cardio-training and weight training, in addition to following a fairly refined diet that comforts him in his training.</span></p><p><span>He sticks to a high-protein, high-carb diet that helps him build muscle and lose fat;&nbsp;and just to clarify that, he eats healthy carbs like vegetables and whole grains, so if you plan on emulating him, put away baked and fried foods.</span></p><p><span>With these celebrities, you can hardly keep up, but leading a healthy life, no matter how big, is a necessity.</span></p><p><span>See also: Danny DeVito height, weight and body measurements</span></p><h2><span>Will Smith Net Worth</span></h2><p><span>Since he’s someone who goes to great lengths to make sure he’s got a particular size and appearance, think instead that we have all of his stats on a golden platter, ready for you to serve.&nbsp;Will has a naturally lean body, but that hasn’t stopped him from pumping it up with the right amount of muscle, he’s roughly 6-8% body fat.</span></p><p><span>His chest is 42 inches, his waist is 33 inches, and his biceps are 16 inches.&nbsp;All that weight lifting must definitely pay off.&nbsp;You know we’re not going to end this without telling you his shoe size.&nbsp;The actor wears a US size 11, EU size 44 and UK size 10.5.&nbsp;There you have it, the stats for Willard Carroll ‘Will’ Smith Jr.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmaG5br%2FMoquhq12dsqqzx61ksJ2ZnLW1ecCnm2aan5nGbrnEmqquqpWisq%2FA0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
