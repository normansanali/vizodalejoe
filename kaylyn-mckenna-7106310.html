She has contributed to websites like Forbes Vetted and CBS Essentials. When she’s not writing, you can find Kaylyn scrolling through TikTok to find the latest must-have products or playing with her goldendoodle, Harley.</p><p>Kaylyn loves testing new products to find the best beauty items (and great deals) for readers. Her recommendations are carefully vetted and she only shares products that she herself uses and enjoys. Most of her recommendations are sustainable and cruelty-free, as she tried to stick to a more plant-based lifestyle.</p><p>Find more of her work on CBS Essentials, Forbes Vetted, among other digital publications.</p><p><strong>Favorite Purchase</strong></p><p>My favorite purchase recently is the Fenty Beauty Eaze Drop skin tint. I bought it after my go-to Nyx BB cream was discontinued. I love how buildable and long-lasting it is. I really like how tinted moisturizers feel on my skin, but I've always had a hard time finding one that was a good shade match. Many tinted moisturizers have limited shade ranges and don't offer good options for people with either pale skin or dark skin, but Fenty Beauty really does offer great options for everyone.</p><h2 class=mntl-bio-education__header>Education</h2><p>Kaylyn received a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration at San Francisco State University.
