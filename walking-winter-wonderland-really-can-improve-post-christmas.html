The <a href=#>official definition of a white Christmas</a> is for one snowflake to be observed falling in the 24 hours of Dec 25 somewhere in the UK.</p><p>By that definition, 2021 and 2020 meet the standard, with six per cent of stations recording snow falling, but less than one per cent of stations reported any snow lying on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>Before that 2020 was also a white Christmas, with 6 six per cent of weather stations recording snow falling, however, only 4 per cent of stations reported any snow lying on the ground.</p><p>But 2010 was the last time there was a widespread covering of snow on the ground on Christmas Day, with more than 40 per cent of weather stations recording snow on the ground by 9am.&nbsp;</p><p>The Met Office says it can forecast if it will be a white Christmas from Dec 20 onwards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwfo9raWhpYWR%2FenvWmqOkoZ6ceri1za2cq2WnpLulsdGlmKecXaeyorjLsmScmZ5itq680aitnmWgpMC1ecKhqaKrpKKutHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
