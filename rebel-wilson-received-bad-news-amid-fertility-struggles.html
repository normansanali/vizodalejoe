To all the women out there struggling with fertility, I feel ya. The universe works in mysterious ways and sometimes it all doesn’t make sense, but I hope there’s light about to shine through all the dark clouds.”</p><p>In the somber shot, the Aussie stood at the beach in a black sweatsuit, looking away from the camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Rebel-Wilson-Struggling-Fertility.jpg><p>The Bridesmaids star has been sharing her <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> journey in the last year, revealing in December 2020 that her fertility inspired her “year of health.”</p><p>“[I knew that I] wasn’t gonna maybe work that much this year,” the Pitch Perfect star explained in an Instagram post at the time. “I knew I was going to have a bit more time. I was also freezing my eggs because — as all good, career women out there should note — that if that’s something that interests you, it’s a pretty good time to do it. I was thinking about fertility and <a href=#>having good quality eggs in the bank</a>, so I was like, ‘OK, I’m going to do this. I’m going to get healthy.’”</p><p>The singer, who went to a “professional place to do a <a href=# data-link=1>detox</a>,” wrote that she had lost about 61 pounds.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The goal was never to be skinny. It was never to fit into a certain dress size,” Wilson concluded at the time. “I put in a goal weight, [165 pounds], because I needed some tangible thing. … What I’m proud of myself is doing that and having a lot more balance now in my life.”</p><p>The comedian was dating businessman <strong>Jacob Busch</strong> at the time, but<a href=#> they split in February</a>. Wilson told Extra later that same month that she was<a href=#> in a “really good place”</a> following their breakup. “I feel like, I don’t know if it’s turning 40 or coming into your own,” she added. “Any kind of breakup is hard and not ideal.”</p><p>The Super Fun Night star explained to the outlet that the relationship had “run its course,” noting, “I am so busy with work, doing [my competitive dog grooming show] Pooch Perfect now, and I have three movies to shoot after this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGarnZKauW7DyKWqqKZdp7KkscivnJ1lkpaxbrrEsKpmmZ2esW6yxKuroqSZqcZuv9OrrKCfnJrAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
