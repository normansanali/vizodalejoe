Daniel Curtin, a resident of Wappingers Falls, was operating a 2023 Yamaha motorcycle traveling eastbound on State Route 299 around 7:15 p.m. The tragic turn of events unfolded when a 2012 Subaru, traveling westbound, crossed the dividing line and collided with Daniel Curtin’s motorcycle.</p><p>Regrettably, Mr. Curtin was pronounced deceased at the accident scene. The New York State Police are actively investigating the incident to understand its circumstances fully.</p><p>This heartbreaking accident serves as a poignant reminder of the perilous conditions faced by motorcyclists on our roadways every day. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that in 2021, there were 6,530 motorcyclist fatalities in the United States, representing a 9 percent increase from the previous year.</p><p>Candice Bond, a seasoned motorcycle accident attorney, emphasized the importance of preserving evidence through an independent investigation in such cases. She noted, “In addition to a police report, an attorney will carefully examine the factors that may have contributed to the accident. Your attorney has the resources to retain expert witnesses, conduct thorough background checks on the involved drivers, locate witnesses, and assess applicable insurance coverage. Serving as a dedicated advocate, an attorney can offer compassionate support to the grieving family of the victim during this challenging period, safeguarding their legal rights while ensuring that the responsible driver is held accountable for violating traffic laws.”</p><p>As the investigation unfolds, the family of Daniel Curtin may consider pursuing a wrongful death claim. In such cases, family members of wrongful death victims may seek damages for the loss of companionship, pain and suffering, and emotional distress stemming from a tragic and catastrophic accident like this one.</p><h5>read more:<a href=#>Raymond R.
