Dolly Parton and Carl Dean have been married since 1966, but they've rarely been seen in public together, and we don't know a lot about their 50-plus-year marriage. They're not exactly <a href=#>J.Lo and Ben Affleck</a> when it comes to PDA. &nbsp;</p><p>In a special International Women’s Day episode of The Kelleigh Bannen Show on Apple Music Country, the <a href=#>legendary country singer</a>, <a href=#>actor</a>, and <a href=#>philanthropist</a> opened up about maintaining this balance between living in the spotlight and protecting her marriage. Parton said that this balance stems from advice she got from her mother.&nbsp;</p><p>“I learned early on,” Parton said, per <a href=#>Today.</a> “And I think my mama told me when I was young, ‘Always keep something back for you. You can give what you’ve got to give, but don’t give it all away. Always keep something for you.’”</p><figure data-testid=IframeEmbed class="IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg hZcniq iframe-embed"></figure><p>Parton added, “There’s a part that belongs to God and to me. It's a sacred place that just is mine and God’s, and I've known how to do that because I think God has directed that.”</p><p>Parton's family falls into that category. “I’ve known how to keep my husband private,” Parton said. “It's just natural to me to protect the things and the people I love and to protect my own privacy.” She added, “I pray also that God will&nbsp;give me enough to share and enough to spare when it comes to my money but also&nbsp;to myself. Let me share everything I can, but let me keep me.”</p><p>Dolly Parton has been performing since she was a child, but became a household name in country music in the ’60s. Parton made her feature-film debut in 1980's <a href=#>9 to 5</a> opposite <a href=#>Jane Fonda</a> and <a href=#>Lily Tomlin</a> and has since appeared in films including Steel Magnolias and Netflix's Christmas on the Square.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauql6YvK570q2mq7FfmbytuNhmp5qqpKS7brbUrKtmpZGZsm6%2FzqacZq6Vp8ZuvsCrnGarpJbBprnEp6usZZGXvLbAjKGcq2Wdlr%2BztcCgnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
