The chapter and its members have been providing as much support as possible to the injured member and we are grateful for their efforts."<p>According to the State College Police Department criminal complaint, the victim says Johnson punched him in the face after he questioned Johnson not having a wristband and Johnson refusing to leave the party.</p><p>But what sparked the punch by Johnson?</p><p>A Penn State Student Affairs office review mentions Johnson allegedly being spit on right before the punch. Immediately after the punch, it appears to be a rugby scrum, with others joining the scuffle, and Johnson backing up and eventually climbing over a fence to get away.</p><p>Some felt Johnson should have been charged with a felony, but the prosecutor in the case, Centre County District Attorney Bernie Cantorna disagreed telling 6 News, "after reviewing video tapes of the incidents, our office concluded that a reduction of the charges to simple assault by mutual combat more fairly reflected the incident in its entirety.”</p><p>Afterwards State College police body cam video shows the officer interview of the victim, who first says he doesn’t need to be hospitalized.</p><p>The victim is eventually hospitalized with a concussion. Here's an update on his condition from his attorney:</p>"He is still having significant issues with migraines. This is a particular problem when he has to focus (such as studying for exams) and when he is working on a computer."<p>Theo Johnson meanwhile continuing to play, hauling in two touchdown passes against UMass.</p><p>“So, you know it’s good to be more involved in the game plan and add more value,” said Johnson is a post-game interview. “I’m hoping to do just that.”</p><p>This past summer, Johnson was sentenced in Centre County court to six months of ARD (Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition) which will allow him to clear the charges from his record.</p><p>Penn State athletics issued a statement: "We are aware of the result of Theo Johnson’s case. These alleged actions do not reflect the values and standards of our programs and have been addressed.”</p><p>And Theo Johnson had another touchdown catch on Saturday in the game against Indiana. For the season he remains one of the Nittany Lions top receivers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmpawtcKNnKamZ56axLR7y6iamqRfpbKvuoysq5qslWKzsLvTm5ilpF2owaK%2BjKeYr6GXlsGmv4yfoJ6klGKur7CMnKauqqSnvLC5jK2fnqddn7yputKopaxlk6S7tb7Or5yrq5mWuW681KeaoWWRqXqnvsCtnKummanGbrzAq6uy</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
