I put my wedding dress on and I burst into tears because I was terrified I wasn’t going to fit into it. It’s fine, but also what precedent are we setting for young girls and young boys, and I get married in two and a half weeks, I’m fine the way I am.”</p><p id=elTyBayDtCgP data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Candice Brown reveals which celebrity is inspiring her wedding dress</a></strong></p><p id=exGFpnwecH3e data-wc=84>Discussing the backlash she had received after being snapped in the bikini, Candice said: “I didn’t ask for those pictures to be taken of me on holiday, neither did my girls, one of which has just had a baby. But the onslaught from that was just horrendous and as a teacher teaching secondary schools, I spent nearly ten years trying to teach students ‘you’re OK as you are. Everyone’s different, everyone’s a different shape, size, everything.’ And then to be having to justify myself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2393f86d3ba1-candice-brown-fiance-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eN-EpETZX5Ha data-wc=6><strong>Candice with her</strong>&nbsp;<strong>fiancé Liam Macaulay</strong></p><p id=eCbzRhKDDNrv data-wc=94>In a photo Candice posted online - of her and her friend - she was inundated with comments asking her if she was pregnant. Not happy, she revealed: “I’m having to justify myself not being pregnant. Because I didn’t breathe in? They don’t know what has happened in my private life, our private life, I don’t know when it ever became OK for someone or anybody to say publicly ‘are you pregnant, you should be ashamed of yourself, you’re drinking when you’re pregnant.’ No, I’d just had a milkshake and quite a big burger.”</p><p id=eg3Ljkse45wn data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>The top 10 celebrity chefs to follow on Instagram</a></strong></p><p id=e8SLdcToRNX5 data-wc=131>The 33-year-old, who's due to get married this month, sent a strong message to the online bullies, saying: “Everybody’s fine the way they are. You look at Tess Holliday on the front of Cosmopolitan, she looks incredible. Who are these people to say ‘that’s not right. You should be this, you should be that?’ No, because Instagram isn’t real life. Real life is that. Real life is wobbly bits and stretch marks. I love cake, I love baking, it’s going to happen, I have an incredible fiancée, I have incredible friends and family, but I am also human. I’m annoyed at myself that it got to me. But it did. On the other side of that, I’m OK now. We need to be setting a better precedent for the younger generation.”</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=eYdCF5R1qV6- data-wc=1><strong>VIDEO:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Home Sweet Home with Great British Bake Off winner Candice Brown</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
