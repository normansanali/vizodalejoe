And after round one, the leaderboard saw an unlikely trio at the top. Star players seemed to be still in a bit of a hangover from the U.S. Open as hardly a few of the top-tier players scored low in Round 1. They had a strenuous day, as most of them are around even par, and will try to make the cut on Friday.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Satoshi Kodaira and Kramer Hickok shot -7 and co-lead after round 1. While Talor Gooch scored -6 and is just a stroke behind the leaders. But these players won’t last all week at the top since many players are steaming behind them to move ahead.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Notable players like Brooks Koepka, Phil Mickelson, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Bryson DeChambeau</a>, and Dustin Johnson were all struggling. Each of these players is around -1, and their primary goal is to make it to the weekend.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2021-05-07T194219Z_418364141_MT1USATODAY16036100_RTRMADP_3_PGA-WELLS-FARGO-CHAMPIONSHIP-SECOND-ROUND.jpg><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><span>Travelers Championship projected cut line&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>The TPC River Highlands is a short and easier course. The overall scoring conditions after day 1 were +0.09 strokes per round. The morning wave saw -0.69, while in the afternoon, it went up to +0.87. Currently, the cut line is at -1, with a total of 75 players hanging there. But according to <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Datagolf,</a> the top 3 projected cutline probabilities are;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><ul class=jsx-5fbc0b8734eedfa8><li class=jsx-1942bf53bf64336><span>2 under par – 41.0%</span></li><li class=jsx-1942bf53bf64336><span>1 under par – 31.4%</span></li><li class=jsx-1942bf53bf64336><span>3 under par – 17.3%</span></li></ul><p><span>The <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>analytics shows</a> the cut will most probably be -2. And the star players need to make a move and score as low as possible since everyone is currently lingering around the edge. But the most successful player of the tournament Bubba Watson and the 2nd most successful player Kevin Streelman have started decently and are just three and four strokes behind, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And after round 1 of the Travelers Championship, Talor Gooch has the highest winning probability with 6.7%. The experienced left-hander Bubba Watson is right behind him with 6.1%.
