When Beyoncé went solo and Swift went pop, their careers reached new levels.</p><p>However, instead of engaging in unfriendly competition, the two superstars have been openly supportive of each other over the years.</p><p>Beyoncé first showed Swift support with a big gesture at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. Recently, they both got ahead of any potential drama between their respective fanbases by showing up to the premieres of each other's concert films.</p><h2 id=beyonc-eacute-supported-taylor-with-a-huge-gesture-at-the-mtv-video-music-awards>Beyoncé Supported Taylor With A Huge Gesture At The MTV Video Music Awards</h2><p>Swift and Beyoncé first crossed paths at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. During her acceptance speech for Best Female Video, Swift was interrupted by Kanye West. West declared that Beyoncé (who was nominated in the same category) should've won instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Lautner was the presenter of the award and there are many shots where it looks like he is laughing in the background. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lautner addressed this incident</a> when he spoke to his wife, Taylor Dome Lautner, on the podcast The Squeeze.</p><p>Lautner said that while West was interrupting Swift, he was under the impression the whole thing was just a pre-planned skit.</p><p>"I presented the award to her," Lautner recalled. "I took five steps back and was standing five feet behind her. And, yeah, in the middle of her giving her ‘thank you’ speech, Kanye jumps on the stage."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar48467529.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued, "I can barely hear it. I can’t see them — I’m just assuming that this whole thing was a practiced and rehearsed skit because why else would Kanye West be jumping up on the stage, interrupting Taylor Swift?"</p><p>Lautner said that while he laughed at first, he soon realized it "wasn't good" when Swift turned around and he saw her face.</p><p>Later in the show, Beyoncé won Video of the Year for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)." Instead of giving a speech herself, Beyoncé invited Swift on stage to redo her speech.</p><p>"I remember being 17 years old, up for my first MTV award with Destiny's Child and it was one of the most exciting moments of my life," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyoncé said</a>, "so I would like for Taylor to come out and have her moment."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:05</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-many-songs-has-taylor-swift-written-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?">How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has penned plenty of hits, but how many songs has she actually written in total?</p><p>Swift then walked on stage, gave Beyoncé a hug, and properly accepted the award for her "You Belong With Me" video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the show, Swift spoke with reporters about the support Beyoncé showed her that night.</p><p>"It was so wonderful and gracious of her," Swift said.

While speaking to KissFMUK ahead of the big night, Swift shared her love for the singer.</p><p>"It’s like, normal for everyone to love Beyoncé, but I love her more than that amount, like more than the normal amount," Swift said. "I try really hard not to let it get creepy. I just really like, channel it into a joyous admiration and appreciation."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar52728356.jpg><p>She continued, "I'm nominated usually against lots of my friends, so you have to — just for the sake of humanity and for the sake of having a good time — legitimately be happy for other people."</p><p>Swift then said that she didn't care if she won the award, she just wanted to see Beyoncé.</p><p>"The only way that I'll be upset, is if we don't get to see Beyoncé," Swift said. "I won't be upset because I didn't win. I'll just be like, 'I wish that we could see her all the time.'"</p><p>In 2021, Beyoncé broke the record for the most Grammy wins by a female artist. That same year, Swift won Album of the Year for "Folklore." This made Swift the first female artist to win the award three times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyoncé showed Swift some love by sending her flowers and a note congratulating her.
