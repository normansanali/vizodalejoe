His widow Judith remarried a man named Victor Pisano, but in 2015 the couple filed for divorce (via <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a>). A prenuptial agreement stated that each person would keep their intellectual property rights from one another in the case of divorce, a useful clause given that both were involved in the entertainment industry as producers.</p><p>An issue arose from the fact that a majority of Judith's earnings came from her late husband, as franchises like "Animal&nbsp;House" and "The Blues Brothers" are still profitable to this day. Pisano claimed that he hadn't waived alimony rights for Belushi-based income, and that those rights weren't covered by the prenup. The claims were limited by a judge, a decision held up by an appeals court. Not everything went Judith's way, however, as debt from a sizable loan from Jim Belushi was determined to be hers alone. Even 30 years after his passing, John&nbsp;Belushi's will had ramifications.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCClG9nb21fnbKzsdJmrqGnXZ67qbHRoquenF2fvKm6jJucpa2jnba0ecyopZ6xXZaztbHRZp%2BeZZSesqV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
