Responding officers found both Blacks deceased in the vestibule of the apartment, according to WJLA.</p><p>After Labang’s slaying but before killing Wendy Black, Rajee Black reportedly took to Facebook Live to explain why he was carrying out the murder-suicide. The suspect explained how his ex-wife had accused him of molesting their children during a three-year custody battle.</p><p>He then says he and his pregnant ex-girlfriend got into an argument that entailed her making similar threats regarding custody.</p><p>“Anyway, I just did something crazy,” he says during the live stream. “I just shot my ex-girlfriend in the head. Felt like a dream. I never thought I would be that guy.”</p><p>He goes on to state that he “can’t go to prison,” so he is going to get revenge on his ex-wife for causing his depression before taking his own life.</p><p>Seconds later, a woman, presumably Wendy Black, is spotted in the background opening and closing the front door. Rajee Black is then seen running in her direction.</p><p>“Today’s the day,” he says before the live stream abruptly ends.</p><p>WJLA reported that the Blacks’ two young children were found unharmed in their father’s car — which was in the parking lot of the apartment where their mother’s murder and father’s suicide occurred. Police said the children did not witness the shooting.</p><p>Police said the double murder-suicide had already transpired by the time they were alerted to the Facebook Live video.</p><p>According to the Baltimore Sun, Rajee Black was linked to several domestic violence cases. The latest, in April 2020, and a peace order from March 2019 were dismissed by a judge.</p><p>Two other domestic violence cases, from July and September 2018, were dropped shortly after they were filed. It is unclear who filed those charges.</p><p>However, the Sun reported that an October 2018 case against Wendy Black was also dismissed shortly after it was filed. It was also unclear who filed charges in that case.</p><p>Reports indicated that Wendy and Rajee Black were nurse anesthetists. Capital Regional Health spokesperson Jania Matthews told the Sun that Labang also worked in the medical field.</p><p>According to the news outlet, Rajee Black filed a federal lawsuit in January against the University of Maryland Medical System, alleging he was wrongfully terminated after he reported a doctor who was hiding drugs in his locker.</p><p><strong>For the latest true crime and justice news,&nbsp;subscribe to the ‘Crime Stories with Nancy Grace’ podcast.
