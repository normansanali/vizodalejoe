Yes please!! PS give this man a #Tony OK?” she captioned the Instagram snap.</p><p>The Office alums previously met up for a coffee date in April. “Ummm what do we have here?! A nice little Monday coffee with the loveliest @msjennafischer … not a bad way to start the week!” Kemper captioned an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram selfie </a>of the pair at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ellie-Kemper-Shares-Which-Office-and-Bridesmaids-Costars-She-Keeps-in-Touch-With-324.jpg><p>Fisher commented on the post: “This was the best! Xoxo ❤️‍🩹.”</p><p>Although Kemper has held on to the friends she’s made in past projects, she’s stepping away from the type of roles she played in The Office, Bridesmaids and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt in her newest film. In Happiness for Beginners, which is based on <strong>Katherine Center</strong>’s novel of the same name, she plays Helen — a woman who signs up for an Appalachian Trail survivalist course after her <a href=#>marriage ends</a>.</p><p>“Helen is going through a really <a href=#>challenging chapter</a> in her life. … She is not feeling so sunny or bright-eyed,” Kemper told Us. “And I loved as an actor being able to tap into that because a lot of the characters I’ve played tend to be optimistic and cheerful, with a pretty good outlook on life. And Helen is not feeling that at the moment. So, it was fun to play, it was a nice departure for me as an actor.”</p><p>Kemper’s costar in the romantic comedy — which hits Netflix on Thursday, July 27 — is <a href=#>Yellowstone</a> star <a href=#><strong>Luke Grimes</strong></a>. The Home Sweet Home Alone actress told Us that Grimes, 39, was a “great partner” in the film. “He’s just lovely and he’s funny and silly and he’s a fantastic actor,” she said.”</p><p>Kemper revealed that several of her costars from the flick — including “icon” <a href=#><strong>Blythe Danner</strong> </a>— have a <a href=#>group text</a>. “Everybody has stayed in such close touch,” she said. “We filmed the movie almost two years ago and everybody is just still friends and going to each other’s premieres and big life events and it’s just a really sweet bond.”</p><p>In addition to great relationships with those she’s shared the screen with, Kemper has a loving husband. She and <a href=#><strong>Michael Koman</strong></a> celebrated their wedding anniversary earlier this month.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ellie-Kemper-Shares-Which-Office-and-Bridesmaids-Costars-She-Keeps-in-Touch-With-323.jpg><p>“11 years of marriage with this guy and he is STEEL the one!!!
