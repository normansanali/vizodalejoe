Somerhalder rose to prominence as Damon Salvatore in The Vampire Diaries. Nikki Reed, on the other hand, has not been on the program.&nbsp;Somerhalder announced the news on Instagram with a photo of Reed clutching her baby belly and wearing a red dress. The post was titled:</p><p>“I’ve always desired a large family since I was a little lad. Thank you, Nik, for that present. ROUND TWO IS HERE!!!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you to this beautiful woman for the gift of life and love, for being the best mom ever and working so hard to make dreams come true!!!”</p><p>Reed also announced the news on Instagram, uploading the same photo and commenting that she has been waiting for this moment for a long time and that it is the finest present she has ever gotten. She went on to say:</p><p>“As you are all aware, I have extremely strict limits when it comes to social media, particularly when it comes to children and what I choose to put out into the public. Thank you so much for doing so, as well as providing optimism, compassion, and LOVE. Some things are just too nice to keep to themselves.”</p><p>Ian Somerhalder and Nikki Reed have another daughter, Bodhi, who was born in July 2017.</p><h2>Nikki Reed works in the entertainment sector as well.</h2><p>Nikki Reed made her acting debut in the 2013 adolescent drama Thirteen. The film was a box office hit, and Reed and Catherine Hardwicke received praise for writing it in six days. She featured in three additional films in 2005 before landing the main part in Mini’s First Time in 2006. She rose to prominence after playing Rosalie Hale in all five parts of the Twilight series. Despite garnering varied reviews, all five films were box office successes.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ian-Somerhalder-1.jpg alt="Ian Somerhalder" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Reed played Sadie Campbell in six episodes of The O.C., a Fox adolescent drama series.

They were engaged the following year, and Reed was seen flashing the ring during the premiere of the Unstopables home fragrance line in New York City.&nbsp;Reed noted that the ring is stunning and that she considers herself fortunate for a variety of reasons.

As much as we want to reveal as much as possible, we still want to retain certain things for ourselves and our families. You don’t get many chances to accomplish that with what we do for a job, so we’ll give it our all.”</p><p>Ian Somerhalder and Nikki Reed married at Topanga Canyon in April 2015 and had their first child in July 2017.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigmqZdqLyusdGhmKWclad6orrDZqWio5ueerOxxJ1kmqqVYrK5vMScq6Kml2LBqbHIq2SsnZOku6V5wqGgpZxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
