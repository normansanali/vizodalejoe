Although self-portraits can now be recorded as videos in the form of vlogs or digital selfies thanks to advancements in technology, there are still ways to distinguish art from the uninspired drudgery of YouTube. Modern art is both praised and derided as a black dot on a white canvas, yet art education allows for a critical form of self-expression that frequently lacks funding, preventing a future generation of Picasso and Basquiat fans from rising to prominence in the art world.</p><p>However, there are plenty of films about well-known Western artists to choose from. There are probably just a few films that garner the same interest as a film about women or artists of colour or BIPOC for every van Gogh movie that has been produced.</p><p>Whatever the case, films about painters have consistently succeeded in conjuring the emotions and ideas that surround their work, serving as superb homages to their lives. These artistically amazing and amusing films on painters are both.</p><p>Updated on April 28, 2023: For your amusement, fresh information has been added to this page.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Andrei Rublev</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Big Eyes</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Edvard Munch</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Frida</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Loving Vincent</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Maudie</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Mr. Turner</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> Painted Fire</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Séraphine</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> Utamaro and His Five Women</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Andrei_Rublev>Andrei Rublev<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Andrei-Rublev.jpg alt="movies about painters on netflix,best movies about painters,movies about drawing,movie about painting heist,movies about art,movies with artists characters,movies about artists lives,new movies about artists,movies about painters,movies about painters life,movies about painters reddit,movies about painters imdb,horror movies about painters,new movies about painters,french movies about painters,biography movies about painters,great movies about painters" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>The 1966 film Andrei Rublev, directed by Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky, is a biographical drama about Russian painter Andrei Rublev. Tarkovsky is best renowned for his <a href=#>science fiction</a> and poetry-inspired films. The last moments featuring Rublev’s original paintings are shot in colour after the majority of the film was shot in <a href=#>black and white</a>.</p><p>It is a substantial epic that explores a turbulent period in Russian history. Conflicts between religions, shifts in governmental power and empire, and one’s trust in one’s art all predominated at this time. This film has been hailed as one of the best films of all time due to the magnificent sets and sequences created by Tarkovsky.</p><h3><span id=Big_Eyes>Big Eyes<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Big-Eyes.jpg alt="movies about painters on netflix,best movies about painters,movies about drawing,movie about painting heist,movies about art,movies with artists characters,movies about artists lives,new movies about artists,movies about painters,movies about painters life,movies about painters reddit,movies about painters imdb,horror movies about painters,new movies about painters,french movies about painters,biography movies about painters,great movies about painters" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>The true account of Margaret Keane (Amy Adams), a woman whose paintings became well-known under her husband’s name, is told in Big Eyes. With their sincere expressions, her trademark style of painting toddlers with oversized eyes managed to move audiences. Margaret was duped into allowing Walter Keane (Christopher Waltz), ever the businessman, to claim her artwork as his own instead of showing her any respect for her work. For many years, the happy family seems content, but as Margaret’s bitterness grows, her relationship with Walter frays. His career stalls when his domineering love causes her art to suffer. As Margaret is compelled to flee from Walter with their daughter, she wonders if she will ever be able to pursue her art again, and the tension reaches a breaking point.</p><p>Tim Bur ton, the director, skillfully changes the mood throughout the movie to reflect Margaret’s ups and downs. The joyful moments are vivid and brilliant, feeling liberated and uplifted. The darker scenes are full of dynamic tension, using the 1960s style sets’ mid-century modern architecture to produce hard angles and lines that symbolise the perils Margaret must face. Big Eyes is a lovely tale about an artist who overcomes obstacles she encounters in her work and in everyday life. Even while it might not be Tim Burton’s most well-liked movie, the ensemble cast gives it their all to pay tribute to a genuinely remarkable painter, making for a watchable film.</p><h3><span id=Edvard_Munch>Edvard Munch<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Edvard-Munch.jpg alt="movies about painters on netflix,best movies about painters,movies about drawing,movie about painting heist,movies about art,movies with artists characters,movies about artists lives,new movies about artists,movies about painters,movies about painters life,movies about painters reddit,movies about painters imdb,horror movies about painters,new movies about painters,french movies about painters,biography movies about painters,great movies about painters" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Three decades before the biographical film Edvard Munch was produced, the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch passed away in 1944. The film was originally a miniseries, but it was compiled for its North American theatrical distribution and Cannes Film Festival presentation. It explores Munch’s <a href=#>biography</a> and the inspirations behind his works of art. Many of the roles were filled by untrained actors. In order to correctly show the response against Munch’s art, the director enlisted the help of those who disagreed with it.</p><h3><span id=Frida>Frida<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Frida.jpg alt="movies about painters on netflix,best movies about painters,movies about drawing,movie about painting heist,movies about art,movies with artists characters,movies about artists lives,new movies about artists,movies about painters,movies about painters life,movies about painters reddit,movies about painters imdb,horror movies about painters,new movies about painters,french movies about painters,biography movies about painters,great movies about painters" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Salma Hayek’s portrayal of Frida Kahlo in the movie Frida earned her an Academy Award nomination. It takes a lot of precision and thought to sort through the complex meanings and tales that Frida Kahlo wove into her narrative; she was a busy but difficult artist. Although the beloved artist’s life is brought to life in Frida, it is challenging to convey her story in under three hours. Even though the story of Frida is not as beautiful as its visuals, it is still gorgeous to watch on a large screen.</p><h3><span id=Loving_Vincent>Loving Vincent<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Loving-Vincent.jpg alt="movies about painters on netflix,best movies about painters,movies about drawing,movie about painting heist,movies about art,movies with artists characters,movies about artists lives,new movies about artists,movies about painters,movies about painters life,movies about painters reddit,movies about painters imdb,horror movies about painters,new movies about painters,french movies about painters,biography movies about painters,great movies about painters" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Loving Vincent, which was released in 2017, made history as the first movie made entirely of oil paintings. An experience never before seen in a movie was created by animating the paintings and adding voiceovers. Even though the subject of Vincent van Gogh and his tragic death may not be entirely novel, this movie was made using 65,000 paintings. Each of those works of art was created in van Gogh’s personal manner. Perhaps assembling other artists to celebrate the life of a beloved artist is the ideal way to create a tribute to them.</p><h3><span id=Maudie>Maudie<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Maudie.jpg alt="movies about painters on netflix,best movies about painters,movies about drawing,movie about painting heist,movies about art,movies with artists characters,movies about artists lives,new movies about artists,movies about painters,movies about painters life,movies about painters reddit,movies about painters imdb,horror movies about painters,new movies about painters,french movies about painters,biography movies about painters,great movies about painters" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>The biographical drama Maudie tells Maud Lewis’s tale (Sally Hawkins). Lewis was a folk artist who gained some notoriety for her vivid and stunning works. Her life, however, was a lot less colourful than her creations. Lewis spent the majority of her life in small quarters, frequently with rough-and-tumble neighbours. Lewis had a kid who died shortly after birth, and despite the fact that he was a rather colourful character, she eventually wed the guy who had employed her as his maid. She also had rheumatoid arthritis, but happily Lewis was still able to paint despite everything.</p><p>Always a gifted actress, Hawkins’ work is frequently credited by reviewers as the movie’s emotional centre and for bringing Lewis’ upbeat spirit to life. The movie is a great way to remember a woman who demonstrated through her work that <a href=#>happiness</a> is attainable with a little bit of hope.</p><h3><span id=Mr_Turner>Mr. Turner<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Mr.-Turner.jpg alt="movies about painters on netflix,best movies about painters,movies about drawing,movie about painting heist,movies about art,movies with artists characters,movies about artists lives,new movies about artists,movies about painters,movies about painters life,movies about painters reddit,movies about painters imdb,horror movies about painters,new movies about painters,french movies about painters,biography movies about painters,great movies about painters" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>mr.turnerEntertainment Although J.M.W. Turner, a British painter, may not be among the most well-known painters in the world, he produced thousands of paintings during his lifetime. Turner was a young prodigy, but Mr. Turner is more interested in his passing. He was a strange man who went to brothels and strapped himself to the front of a ship to get ideas. Over time, he managed to win the public’s affection and enmity for his actions. This film features excellent photography, strong performances, and a distinct goal in mind. Mr. Turner, though, is one of the better biopics of artists.</p><h3><span id=Painted_Fire>Painted Fire<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Painted-Fire.jpg alt="movies about painters on netflix,best movies about painters,movies about drawing,movie about painting heist,movies about art,movies with artists characters,movies about artists lives,new movies about artists,movies about painters,movies about painters life,movies about painters reddit,movies about painters imdb,horror movies about painters,new movies about painters,french movies about painters,biography movies about painters,great movies about painters" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Despite having directed over a hundred films and being regarded as one of the best directors to ever come out of South Korea, Painted Fire stands out among his work. Jang Seung-op, a Joseon painter, is its subject. One of the men who fundamentally altered Korean art history was Jang, one of the few artists to occupy a ranked position in the Joseon court.</p><p>Along with scenes from Korea’s political conflicts with Japan, the film includes vignettes from his artistic routines and works, evolving into art in the process.</p><h3><span id=Seraphine>Séraphine<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Seraphine.jpg alt="movies about painters on netflix,best movies about painters,movies about drawing,movie about painting heist,movies about art,movies with artists characters,movies about artists lives,new movies about artists,movies about painters,movies about painters life,movies about painters reddit,movies about painters imdb,horror movies about painters,new movies about painters,french movies about painters,biography movies about painters,great movies about painters" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Séraphine Louis, a self-taught painter from France, had an incredible journey to success. The biographical Séraphine charts her development from a middle-aged housewife with artistic talent to her initial oblivion by the art world.</p><p>Many of Louis’ paintings depict floral arrangements, everyday items, and religious artefacts because they were greatly influenced by the natural world around them. Her aesthetic inspirations are explored in the film, giving audiences an inside look at how she thinks and is creative.</p><h3><span id=Utamaro_and_His_Five_Women>Utamaro and His Five Women</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Utamaro-and-His-Five-Women.jpg alt="movies about painters on netflix,best movies about painters,movies about drawing,movie about painting heist,movies about art,movies with artists characters,movies about artists lives,new movies about artists,movies about painters,movies about painters life,movies about painters reddit,movies about painters imdb,horror movies about painters,new movies about painters,french movies about painters,biography movies about painters,great movies about painters" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Director Kenji Mizoguchi created Shochiku Utamaro and His Five Ladies in 1946 while Japan was still under American occupation. A samurai trainee and aspiring artist challenges the Japanese painter Kitagawa Utamaro to a painting fight during the samurai era. Five of these women compete to become his lover because he is a brilliant artist who draws inspiration from women. Although the film’s episodic format may be unfamiliar to Western viewers, creativity and artistry have been used to seamlessly transition between scenes.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="movies about painters on netflix,best movies about painters,movies about drawing,movie about painting heist,movies about art,movies with artists characters,movies about artists lives,new movies about artists,movies about painters,movies about painters life,movies about painters reddit,movies about painters imdb,horror movies about painters,new movies about painters,french movies about painters,biography movies about painters,great movies about painters" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
