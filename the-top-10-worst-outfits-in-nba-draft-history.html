The draft night has seen its share of ill-fitting suits and outrageous styling. Together with Fan Arch, let's playfully recount the ten most outrageous garbs in the NBA draft in this article.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>1. Darko Milicic (2003, 2nd overall by the Detroit Pistons)</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Darko Milicic tops this list thanks to the questionable tie he chose to wear. It might raise an eyebrow as to why someone would appear in that outfit when you were the&nbsp;2nd overall pick. Unfortunately, his ill-fitting suit and his questionable taste in neckties is forever etched in the history of the worst draft day suits.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>2. Amar'e Stoudemire (2002, 9th overall by the Phoenix Suns)&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Amar'e Stoudemire was undoubtedly talented on the court, but his draft night fit in 2002 certainly wasn't one that anyone would remember fondly.</span></p><h3><strong>3. Maurice Taylor (1997,&nbsp;14th overall by Los Angeles Clippers)</strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His garish party suit, with an overall lack of elegance in his style, would create a lasting draft night fashion legacy.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>4. Joakim Noah (2007, 9th overall by the Chicago Bulls)</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Joakim Noah's 2007 Draft night outfit was a color wheel nightmare. Enormous hair aside, the suit, in all its bright blueness, was his undoing. A look no doubt still seared into our collective memory of draft night fashion faux-pas for ages to come.</span></p><h3><strong>5. Drew Gooden (2002,&nbsp;4th overall by Memphis Grizzlies)</strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The 2002 draft night ensemble of Drew Gooden is an ideal example. Everything about the jacket, from its length to the way it buttons up and down, was no bueno for him, hence establishing himself as one of the worst-dressed draftees in history.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>6. Eric Gordon (2008, 7th overall by Los Angeles Clippers)</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The wide tie and white collar made for a terrible fashion faux pas of epic proportions.</span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>When Eric Gordon was drafted to the Clippers in 2008 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/MaxKkfmPzx</a></p>â€” Farbod Esnaashari (@Farbod_E) <a href=#>February 9, 2023</a><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>7. Samaki Walker (1996, 0th overall by Dallas Mavericks)</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite being the ninth pick overall in the draft, Samaki's outfit from his first night is an all-time Hall of Shame winner among poorly dressed draftees. With an outfit that did nothing but reek of "I don't know fashion,"</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>8. Larry Johnson (1991, 1st overall by Charlotte Hornets)</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As the number 1 pick overall in the draft of 1991, Larry Johnson also did not fare well in fashion on his NBA Draft night suit. It's now a draft night relic warning that even top picks are not above choosing lousy fashion.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>9. Tim Thomas (1997,&nbsp;7th overall,&nbsp;New Jersey Nets)</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Between the dress shirt, one skinny and unknotted tie on top of another, and</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>too many lapels layered on a shiny blazer that looked about ten sizes too big for him, high draft or not at an all-time low.</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>10. Hakeem Olajuwon (1984, 1st overall by Houston Rockets)</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The least fashionable outfit in the history of NBA drafts was an iconic ensemble, but it earns this spot as basketball's most notorious one.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The NBA Draft is a hallowed house of broken hoops, dreams, and hideous sartorial nightmares. They show that not even future NBA stars are above making bad wardrobe decisions as we count down the top 10 all-time worst outfits in draft history. From the misfits of these ensembles, a vivid tapestry of draft night fashion has </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>been woven</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> that will continue to fuel hours upon days and years' worth of conversation.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfqbWmedOop2ZpYGLEsL7SrWSoraSbtrW%2FjKKlZqaSlnqlvsCfq2agmajBsL7Y</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
