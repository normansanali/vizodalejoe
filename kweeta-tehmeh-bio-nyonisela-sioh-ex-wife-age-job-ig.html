Nyonisela and his ex-wife chose to get married on his brother Francis K. Sio’s birthday which is on 9 November.</p><p>But, it remains unclear for how long they were in a relationship and stayed married together.

She is not available on any of the social media platforms including Instagram and Facebook (@malomine), which she deleted after her husband’s relationship went viral. So, unearthing facts on whether she was seeing someone at the moment is impossible. She has been frequently featured on her family’s socials but there are no updates on her current status including her relationship.</p><p>Talking about her ex-husband, Nyonisela is dating NeNe Leakes. After the death of her husband, the reality star seems to have moved on after losing her husband in early September 2021.</p><p>NeNe appeared with a new guy, Nyonisela Sioh, proprietor of Nyoni Couture, for her 54th birthday in December 2021.

Brentt, her son, planned the birthday celebration.</p><p>Nyonisela wore a striking lavender suit with a double-breasted jacket and peaked lapels, a white V-neck T-shirt, and casual brown shoes.</p><p>Following the birthday post, followers appeared to be less than enthusiastic about the growing romance. One user wrote on Facebook, “God! That was fast… If someone is the Love of my Life, I won’t be quick to be in another relationship. I’ll need time to heal”. Similarly, another wrote, “My sweet husband just died from cancer on Oct 21st and there is NO WAY I can even think about dating again, nonetheless do it”</p><p>However, NeNe hasn’t addressed the relationship herself.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Old Is Kweeta Tehmeh?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Kweeta Tehmeh is over the age of 40 as of 2021.
