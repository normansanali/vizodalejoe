In the past, <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Ne-Yo</a> revealed started wearing hats as a child after his hair began receding while he was in middle school. He was <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">ridiculed</a> so badly for his thinning hairline that teachers gave him permission to wear his hat in class.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-887 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 medrectangle-4 medrectangle-4887 adtester-container adtester-container-887" data-ez-name=allhiphop_com-medrectangle-4><span id=div-gpt-ad-allhiphop_com-medrectangle-4-0 ezaw=580 ezah=400 class=ezoic-ad></span></span></p><p>So it should come as no surprise that the “So Sick” hitmaker doesn’t like his hat being removed, as one unlucky fan discovered when she whipped his headpiece off during a recent concert.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a clip circulating online, a female fan can be seen dancing on stage while wearing the star’s iconic hat. However, it soon becomes clear that Ne-Yo didn’t find her stunt funny. He claimed the woman isn’t a “Ne-Yo’ fan” before reclaiming his hat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“She know good G####### well she wasn’t supposed to grab my hat,” he added before directing the fan offstage. “Get your ass back over there,’ he said, guiding her towards the rear of the stage. Ne-Yo then called for another fan to come up, but it became clear the first woman wasn’t ready to leave. He walked over to her and directed a mock kick toward the woman’s rear end as the crowd cheered. Check out the clip below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Meanwhile, in other Ne-Yo news, the singer recently received an invitation to the White House. The grammy-Award winner will perform at President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden’s July Fourth celebrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGilnmWppHqju86tqmaekaN6sLLFZqqtmZeaeqKy056pZquYmnqzscyorZ6rXZ22tHnTq5idnZ2Wv6x5x5qraA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
