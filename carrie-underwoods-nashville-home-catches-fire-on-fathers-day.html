The call was later upgraded to a structure fire.</p><p>“Crews from all eight of our stations responded,” officials said in a statement <a href=# rel=noopener>via X</a> on Sunday, June 16. “Fairview Fire provided a tanker and crew as well. Upon arrival, 1401 found flames coming from the garage. Crews were able to knock down the fire quickly to prevent spread into the house.”</p><p>The cause of the fire is under investigation and there are no injuries to report. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>WKRN</a>, investigators are working to determine if the fire was sparked by a UTV parked next to the garage.</p><p>While it’s unclear if the fire affected Underwood’s Father’s Day plans, the “Before He Cheats” singer<i> </i>shared a glimpse into her weekend via Instagram Stories when she shared a photo with two of her animals.</p><p>“Sheep selfie with Gray and Gary…” Underwood, 43, wrote on Sunday before any fire broke out.</p><p>Despite being one of <a href=#><i>American Idol</i></a>’s biggest success stories — currently performing a Las Vegas residency at Resorts World — Underwood assures fans that her life at home in Tennessee with sons Isaiah, 9, and <a href=#>Jacob</a>, 5, is totally normal.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’re just really normal people and I’m so thankful that we are,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>People</i></a> in March 2020. “My kids are my alarm. My husband and I are trying this thing where we get up earlier so we can have a little quiet time before the kids wake up. Then we have breakfast together, and it’s all about the mad dash out the door.”</p><p>Although a calendar journal is used to help keep things organized, Underwood knows that things can always come up. One thing she always tries to make time for, however, is a good workout.</p><p>“I’m a health nerd. It’s a passion,” she explained. “I don’t pamper myself often — and maybe I should be a little better at that — but working out to me is that. It helps me balance.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmaKntqZ51KebnqqnpLylv4ynmKygpp65rbGMoaamnV2YrrWvx56qZp6Zp7Juu81mnZqsmJq%2FtHnDmrBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
