Nina Parker will be the presenter of the real estate drama. Nina Parker is a fashion designer and writer. The 42-year-old began her own plus-size apparel line a year ago.</p><p>The program Buy My House will showcase people selling their homes to real estate tycoons. Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman, Corcoran Group CEO Pamela Liebman, NFL Linebacker Brandon Copeland, and investment property magnate Danisha Wrighster are among the real estate moguls on the episode. These homeowners will have to persuade the tycoons to purchase their homes.</p><p>The official summary of Buy My House is as follows:</p><p>“Incredible and one-of-a-kind properties are on the market as owners reveal emotive backstories and participate in heart-pounding negotiations with the tycoons.”</p><h2>Nina Parker from Buy My House co-hosts Nightly Pop.</h2><p>Nina Parker started her career in San Francisco at a small NBC news station before transferring to Los Angeles. She used to work here as the talent, producer, and weekend manager of the internet-turned-television program, TMZ. She then worked as an entertainment news journalist for CBS’s The Insider and as the host of Love and Hip Hop, VH1’s top-rated reunion program series.&nbsp;Parker has been on various television programs as a pop culture expert, including The Wendy Williams Show and The Talk, as well as as a contributor and fill-in presenter for Access Live on NBC.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nina-Parker-1.jpg alt="Nina Parker" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She is well-known for her role as a co-host of ENightly !’s Pop, a late-night entertainment news program that launched in 2018.&nbsp;In addition to presenting, the Buy My House host recently teamed with Macy’s to develop a size-inclusive collection of ready-to-wear clothing. She described her goal for her plus-size apparel business in an interview with Essence:</p><p>“I believe it is critical that if you remain devoted, work hard, and develop your relationships, people will recognize your merit ethic.”</p><p>Her apparel brand includes power mesh jeans, maxi dresses, and business casual workwear outfits.</p><p>Nina commented about her cooperation with Macy’s:</p><p>“I felt Macy’s would not only understand but also totally embrace my style.” Nina Parker’s collection contains designs that may be worn casually or for a formal event.”</p><p>Starting her own clothing line was always on Nina’s “vision board,” which she successfully visualized. As a result, she got a call from Reunited Clothing one beautiful day. They told her that they admired her fashion sense and invited her to create their next collection of plus-size apparel.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nina-Parker-2.jpg alt="Nina Parker" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She highlighted Lizzo when asked who she would want to see in her clothes brand. Despite the fact that the great singer is busy with her own clothing line, Yitty, Parker would want to see Lizzo in her Macy’s apparel line. She went on to tell BET:</p><p>“I’ve already connected with the majority of the folks I’d want to see in it. I enjoy seeing regular folks in clothing that look amazing and tag me so I can see how they style them. It’s been a joy to see the improvement.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiloqaRYr2ivsqeqWaho2Kzpq3TrqmenF2WwG6tjKGmrKxdpLNuusStnaWhqGKxs63MmmSbraliurp5x6isrJ1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
