Going forward, it plans to put on four major PPVs each year, starting in 2020.</p><p>WWE's calendar can feel a little loaded. There was a point during the latter half of 2018 when we were peppered with a litany of big shows in a very short space of time. SmackDown 1000, <a href=#>Evolution</a>, Crown Jewel, and Survivor Series if our memories serve us correctly. We were basically all WWE-ed out by the end of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>WWE has done a better job of spacing out its big shows this year. What we now need to be careful of is the addition of <a href=#>AEW</a>'s PPVs to the wrestling calendar. Both companies need to be wary of not only their own schedules, but also how closely they book their own shows to their rivals. Later this month, we have a situation where WWE and AEW will put on shows back-to-back.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>AEW Has Been Airing Ads During Hobbs & Shaw Screenings</a></strong></p><p>After <a href=#>NXT UK</a> TakeOver: Cardiff takes place in the UK, AEW's <a href=#>All Out</a> will air in the US. Thanks to the time difference, the shows won't clash. However, that's still a lot of wrestling for those of us who will be watching both shows live. The chances of that happening again in 2019 are slim to none. That's because, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>, AEW will only play host to one more PPV in 2019 after All Out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/aew-all-out-moxley-omega.jpg><p>What's more, it doesn't plan on swamping its 2020 PPV schedule either. Again according to WON, AEW's plan is to stage four PPVs a year. We're assuming that will roughly be one every three months, hence <a href=#>Double Or Nothing</a> and All Out being three months apart. It also doesn't seem to include smaller shows such as <a href=#>Fyter Fest</a> and <a href=#>Fight For The Fallen</a>.</p><p><strong>As for the immediate future, we imagine once All Out is done and dusted, all of AEW's focus will be on its TV debut. AEW's weekly show will be airing on TNT every Wednesday starting on October 2, 2019. That coupled with <a href=#>SmackDown</a>'s move to Fox means October is set to be one of the biggest months in wrestling history. We can't wait!</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p style=text-align:center><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>Bully Ray Pitches "The Final TLC" For SummerSlam 2020</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeemsS0e8CermaooKt6sbjAp6pmmZapsrN5wKWjZqelqXpzfJFpZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
