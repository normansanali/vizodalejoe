Following months of troubles, however, they both filed for divorce last Friday and finalized the divorce that same day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, Brady said, "I'm really focused on two things: taking care of my family and certainly my children, and secondly, doing the best job I can to win football games."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The football star famously unretired this March, just more than a month after he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a38971509/gisele-bundchen-tom-brady-note-nfl-retirement/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="announced his exit" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">announced his exit</a> from the sport to focus on his family and other projects. While the supermodel supported her then husband in his decision publicly, she later said in an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/fashion/a41095078/gisele-bundchen-interview-future-plans/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=ELLE class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">ELLE</a> that she wished he would be "more present" at home and with their children. "But ultimately, I feel that everybody has to make a decision that works for [them]. He needs to follow his joy, too. He also needs to continue with what makes him happy," she added at the time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On his show this week, Brady explained that no matter what issues he's dealing with in private, he will always give his all on the field. And when the game is over, his focus is his children. The athlete shares son Benjamin, 12, and daughter Vivian, 9, with Bündchen. He is also dad to son John Edward, 15, from his former relationship with Bridget Moynahan.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"So, that's what professionals do. You focus at work when it's time to work, and then when you come home you focus on the priorities that are at home. All you can do is the best you could do. That's what I'll just continue to do as long as I'm working and as long as I'm being a dad," Brady said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He also admitted that having his and Bündchen's divorce "play out in front of a lot of people" makes a difficult situation even harder. But, he said, "We all have our unique challenges in life. We're all humans. We do the best we could do."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I have incredible parents that have always taught me the right way to do things. I want to be a great father to my children and always try to do things the right way as well," Brady added. "And to deal with things in your life that have challenges, you wanna deal with them in the best possible way. So, I want to always be able to hold my head high on and off the field, and I'm gonna try to continue to do that for as long as I'm here."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In their divorce settlement, Brady and Bündchen agreed on joint custody of their children.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an Instagram Story confirming the separation, the model wrote, "My priority has always been and will continue to be our children whom I love with all my heart. We will continue co-parenting to give them the love, care and attention they greatly deserve."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though there were rumors Brady would retire from football for good once the current season ends, he suggested last week that they are not true.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On his SiriusXM show, Brady said, "I've never quit on anything in my life. I made a commitment to this team and I love this team and I love this organization." He also added that while there "was a retirement in the past … there's no immediate retirement" in his future.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
