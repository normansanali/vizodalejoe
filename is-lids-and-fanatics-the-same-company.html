Both are well-known for offering a wide range of sports merchandise and fan gear, but are they the same company? This article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis to answer this question and shed light on the relationship between Fanatics and Lids.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Overview of Fanatics and Lids</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Fanatics</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1><a href=#>Fanatics</a> is a leading sports merchandise and fan gear retailer that competes with brands like Rally House, Barstool Sports, and WWE. It boasts an overall score of 4.6, based on 73 ratings on Knoji. The company has an extensive global footprint and offers a diverse range of sports-related products, including apparel, headwear, and collectibles. Fanatics is also involved in philanthropy, diversity and inclusion, sustainability, and brand protection.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Lids</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Lids, on the other hand, is a popular NFL brand that competes with brands like NFLShop.com, Philadelphia Eagles Shop, and Miami Dolphins. It has an overall score of 4.4, based on 71 ratings on Knoji. Lids specializes in fan and fashion-oriented headwear and apparel, with a strong presence across North America, Europe, and Australia. Despite its popularity, Lids has some limitations in terms of financing support and certain brand values.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Ownership and Relationship</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Majority Ownership</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>One key aspect that links <a href=#>Fanatics</a> and Lids is the ownership structure. Fanatics is the majority owner of Lids, positioning itself as the leader in physical sports retail. This strategic move has allowed Fanatics to leverage Lids' extensive physical retail presence, with over 2,000 retail locations across North America, Europe, and Australia.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Business Operations</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Fanatics has tapped Lids to operate the physical retail portion of many significant, long-term, omnichannel relationships that the company has with top sports partners globally. This includes operating flagship stores for major sports leagues such as the NBA and NHL in key locations like New York City, as well as NBA Stores in London, Paris, and Australia.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Financial and Subsidiary Analysis</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Financial Growth and Consolidation</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1><a href=#>Fanatics'</a> financial growth and consolidation have been noteworthy, with expected revenue growth of approximately 30% in 2023, inclusive of the consolidation of the Lids business. This growth trajectory is anticipated to continue, driven by organic growth, one-time sporting events, and new contractual relationships in various subsidiaries.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Subsidiary Analysis</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Fitch has determined a high linkage between Fanatics Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary, Fanatics Collectibles Intermediate Holdco, Inc. This strong linkage contributes to an equalization of the IDRs, indicating a robust relationship within the company's subsidiary structure.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Business Offerings and Brand Values</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Product Offerings</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Fanatics and <a href=#>Lids</a> both offer a wide range of sports merchandise, but each has its unique strengths. Fanatics boasts a diverse set of offerings, including officially licensed products, while Lids specializes in fan and fashion-oriented headwear and apparel.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Brand Values</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Fanatics has been recognized for its positive brand values, ethical supply chain, sustainability commitment, and commitment to racial equity. On the other hand, Lids has some limitations in terms of financing support and certain brand values, as it does not adhere to ethical supply chain practices or publish a commitment to racial equity.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While Fanatics and Lids are distinct brands with their own unique offerings and brand values, they are connected through a majority ownership relationship. Fanatics has strategically leveraged Lids' physical retail presence to enhance its global reach and strengthen its position in the sports merchandise market.
