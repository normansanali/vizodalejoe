It goes without saying that years after the original series ended, viewers were devastated to see a childhood classic reach its finale, and a live-action series has some big shoes to fill. Some familiar faces (or rather, voices) popped up during the trailer, much to the delight of those who grew up watching Fairly Oddparents in its prime (present company included). Here are the confirmed cast members for Fairly Oddparents: Fairly Odder.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>In Fairly Odder, the college-aged&nbsp;Timmy Turner is played by Caleb Pierce, who has previously appeared on&nbsp;Insecure, The Big Bang Theory and Grey’s Anatomy.
