While performing his hit song “Montero (Call Me By Your Name),” the singer was gyrating against a pole when suddenly his eyes went wide and he stood straight up, grabbing the seam of his tight pants. He ripped them, but SNL is live, so he kept going.</p><p>Lil Nas X spent the remainder of his performance with a hand over his groin. Luckily, he only had about 30 seconds left, but it did ruin what was clearly supposed to be a skilled pole dance routine.</p><p>“Then i ended up ripping my pants and couldn’t finish,” the rapper continued. “Everything happens for a reason tho lol.”</p><p>The <a href=#>performer changed outfits</a> and carried on with his second song, “Sun Goes Down,” without any major issues.</p><p>One wardrobe malfunction, a whole lot of nerves and a new troupe of dancers couldn’t ruin his night. “Thank u snl for my favorite night of my career!! i love u!” he tweeted.</p><p>In another Sunday morning message, Lil Nas X (real name Montero Lamar Hill) promised that the wardrobe malfunction was not scripted. “I know i do a lot of planned s–t but ripping my pants on live television is not one of them,” he added.</p><p>The Georgia native also posted a TikTok watching his moment of terror and <a href=#>couldn’t hold back his laughter</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lil-Nas-X-Had-Serious-SNL-Performance-Anxiety-Before-Wardrobe-Malfunction.jpg><p>Lil Nas X rose to fame in 2019 with his hit song “Old Town Road,” featuring <a href=#><strong>Billy Ray Cyrus</strong></a>. The country singer told Us Weekly in January 2020 that <a href=#>he considers the rapper to be part of his family</a>.</p><p>“I have adopted Lil Nas X,” Cyrus, 59, told Us at the time. “I feel like I would die for that boy, I really would. I love him so much. I’m so proud of him, and I’ll stand with him till the very end.”</p><p>The father of <a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Noah Cyrus</strong></a> added, “Every member of my family loves Lil Nas and he is family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOipF2jrrR512aumqtdlrOzrcidZJudlqS%2FpnnSp6Nmr5GnsbO7wZ5kppmcm8Kvr9Oipqdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
