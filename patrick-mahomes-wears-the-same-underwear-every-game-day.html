I only wear them for game day though, so they’re not too worn down. They’re not nasty,” he said, noting that “I wash ‘em every once in a while at least.”</p><p>“If we’re on a hot streak, I can’t wash them,” he confidently admitted. “I gotta just keep it rollin.’ As long as I’m winning football games I’ll keep the superstition going.”</p><p>Former Chiefs quarterback, <strong>Chad Henne</strong>, previously opened up about Patrick’s underwear during a February episode of “<a href=# rel=noopener>The Adam Schefter Podcast</a>.”</p><p>When Schefter, 54, asked Henne, 38, what is something sees every game day that the audience doesn’t, the NFL star replied, “The superstitions. [Patrick] has to have a certain thing each and every day … [the] same pair of underwear that probably not a lot of people know. On game day, he’s been wearing it since I’ve been a part of it.”</p><p>Henne continued, joking, “[Patrick] is like like ‘Dude, what are you doing? Checking out <a href=#>my underwear</a>?” He also revealed that Patrick’s briefs are red and either “Hannes or lululemon.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mahomes-Admits-to-Wearing-the-Same-Pair-of-Briefs-Every-Game-Day-They-re-Not-Nasty-.-040.jpg><p>“He comes in the locker room — boom, it’s right there. I’ll be stretching, and like I said, you just glimpse up, and you’re like, ‘Damn, kid’s wearing them again.’ This definitely has to be a superstition and a good-luck charm, for sure,” Henne explained.</p><p>Brittany, 28, and Patrick have been together since their high school days and tied the knot in March 2022. They’ve welcomed two kids together — daughter Sterling, 2, and son Bronze, 11 months.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Like Patrick, Brittany has <a href=#>a game day style ritual</a>, often using the sporting events to dress up in preppy and festive outfits. From red and yellow ensembles to match the team’s colors to garments with her last name printed on them, she always looks her best.</p><p>Earlier this month, the entire family posed for <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>’s brand, Skims. In the images, they adorably<a href=#> matched in flannel pajamas</a> and more loungewear. They posed together and Brittany even gave Bronze a kiss while Patrick cuddled with Sterling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Wutb7InKJmpZGdvK6x0maunpmiqHq1tMRmqpqllWLCr7DEq66emaJisrex0bJkoJmdmnqlrdho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
