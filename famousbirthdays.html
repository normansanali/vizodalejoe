He is a reputed character actor famous for his <strong>portrayal of evil characters</strong> of volatile nature.&nbsp;</p><h2>CHILDHOOD AND EARLY LIFE</h2><p><strong>Bruce Dern</strong> was born in a distinguished and wealthy family. His father John Dern was a lawyer. His paternal grandfather George was a Secretary of War in President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s office and was a former Utah Governor. His mother’s family owned one of Chicago's top departmental stores. His maternal granduncle was the poet Archibald MacLeish. He often mocked at the formalities associated with his family's upper-class lifestyle and was not very comfortable following the etiquette.</p><p><strong>Bruce Dern</strong> attended The Choate School and also The University of Pennsylvania. During his school and University days, he actively participated in sports as a long distance runner. He was a regular in <strong>the University Track Team</strong> and excelled in the sport.
