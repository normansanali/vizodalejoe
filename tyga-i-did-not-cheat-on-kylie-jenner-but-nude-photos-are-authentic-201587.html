However, Jenner, 17, need not worry just yet, according to Tyga's lawyer, Lee Hutton.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 7, Hutton told <a href=#>TMZ</a> that while the photos in question are authentic (the rapper's distinctive stomach tattoos are clearly visible), Tyga did not send them to transgender model Mia Isabella. "The allegations are false and socially irresponsible during a time when many Americans are celebrating equality,” Hutton said in a statement, arguing that the person on the receiving end of Tyga's texts is out to "maliciously shame" Jenner’s boyfriend.</p><p>In the series of text message screenshots furnished by Isabella and posted by transgender <a href=#>TV personality<strong> B. Scott</strong></a> on his gossip blog, Tyga first sends a photo of his erect penis to the recipient, and then follows up with a photo of his face to confirm it<strong>'</strong>s really him. Acknowledging the penis pic with a smile emoticon, the recipient then engages in small talk with Tyga when he asks what they're up to. "Making pancakes writing chilling with my pups," replies the other texter. When Tyga responds with a headshot selfie per request, his recipient texts back a simple "adorable." They also make plans to get together later that week.</p><p>On his blog, Scott says Isabella has been engaged in a relationship with Tyga for the last three years, including when he was with Blac Chyna, the mother of his 2-year-old son, King.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Jenner has remained mum on the rumors of her man stepping out with another woman, Tyga indirectly addressed the scandal on <a href=#>Instagram</a> Tuesday. "My focus is always on the positive and building up those around me," he wrote. "I'll never understand why people choose hate and negativity over anything else."</p><p>"The devil is working hard today," he added via <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatsZeWeqp5w6KbZqafqXqktMSaq2annmK4urjInmSjnZ6jsrN5wa6rZqalmbJuvMeoq6irXZa%2FpnnArquhnZ6ptqR5kWlobnBnZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
