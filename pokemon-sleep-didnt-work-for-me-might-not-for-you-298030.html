For the record, I have an android phone with the most up to date software. Anyway, I thought about downloading it and eventually decided to do so, since I wanted to be on the ground floor of the download, to be among the first to try it.</p><p>It didn't take too long to download from the Google Play Store. Once I started the app, however, I started to think that I would start having issues. The download of the actual game took a long time, and once I got it started, I was required to download an immediate update. This update put me at 1.01 (the current standard), but this also took me a long time to get settled. It was disappointing that the "game" was suggesting that my phone be plugged in to load. It burned through A LOT of my battery to get it to run. I also couldn't have any other apps running or even any other notifications available while it was being downloaded, which is a bit ridiculous. The final straw, however, was the fact that my phone legitimately crashed while I was dealing with it due to the download. It definitely should not have done that. As a result, I got rid of my account on the app and uninstalled. In addition, when I saw a review or 2 on the Google Play Store, they said that they couldn't get past the tutorial stage, which is dumb. Imagine doing all of the gameplay time only to be stuck on tutorial mode. We as a community have been waiting for <b>4 Years</b> for this, and it may not even properly work on all phones? In the tech business, we would say, "Go back to the drawing board and try again".</p><p>In summary, here were my issues:<br>1. Download of actual game took a long time, and the immediate update took a long time to load.<br>2. The game took A LOT of my battery to run.<br>3. No other apps or notifications could run while Sleep was being used.<br>4. The app crashed my phone, even though I am up to current updates (I make sure to do so). This was even after I decreased the framerate from 60 fps to 30. This was my final straw.</p><p>Now, my issues may not be consistent across all phones, but I just wanted to let people know that, as it is rolled out, people that were really wanting to use it or were excited because it "is a Pokemon thing", might be very disappointed. <b>Love the Franchise, hate the app.</b></p><p>== This is a Public Service Announcement ==</p><p><b>If you have any issues like mine, look at this:<br></b></p></td><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyxu8qepKimXai5prHPZpuinJ6peri70aRkn6eiYrqmecyinqGsXaO8tXnFqKlmsZ%2Bqe3OFl2lqaWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
