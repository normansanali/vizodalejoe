The entire stream will be hosted in a jail setting with popular streamers and internet stars role-playing as inmates and prison guards. The stream would feature artists and content creators such as Druski, Offset, YourRAGE, and NLE Choppa&nbsp;for its entire duration.</p><p>It did not take long for something controversial to happen in such a stream. The stream started on October 27th and would last for almost a week. On the first day itself, the stream has already been making waves on the Internet. The situation takes place between rapper <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NLE Choppa</a>, who plays an inmate, and adult star Teanna Trump, who plays a prison guard.</p><p>In the stream, Kai Cenat and his friends will be in jail for seven days. They will be locked behind bars and on-camera 24/7. This particular situation took place during the daytime when most inmates could be seen hanging out in a common area. The CCTV footage then cuts to the public toilet, where NLE Choppa and Teanna Trump can be seen.</p><p>Keep Exploring: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Sit your silly a** down,” Rapper Nicki Minaj hangs up on Kai Cenat on Instagram Live, fans react</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nle-choppa-flashes-teanna-trump-in-prison-washroom><strong>NLE Choppa flashes Teanna Trump in Prison washroom</strong></h2><p>The context of the clip is quite unclear, as the footage cuts to the CCTV toilet abruptly. There is no information as to what was going on there before the clip. In the CCTV footage, NLE Choppa can be seen standing in one of the toilet stalls with the door half open and the toilet seat down. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Teanna Trump</a>, who is dressed up as a guard, is standing near the gate with a nightstick in her hand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kai-Cenat-Prison-Livestream.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NLE Choppa</a> tried to close the door. Before the door can close all the way, Teanna Trump pushes in the door and does not allow him to close it. NLE tries to resist by pushing the door from the inside, but Teanna forces her way in as she barges the door. Inside, NLE Choppa can be seen “flashing his deal”. He immediately shouts, “Yo yo!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>It is unclear as to what was going on here. Many internet users claim NLE Choppa was “trying to get head” from Teanna Trump. Teanna hesitates and shuts the door as she steps out of the stall. Towards the end of the clip, Kai suddenly appears on camera and can be seen jogging away from the frame as he shouts, “Oh, no!”</p><p>Fans are already enjoying the prison from day 1. Some can say it is just a teaser and fans can expect much wild content during the full 7-day prison livestream with these influencers and rappers living in the prison.</p><p>In case you missed it:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xKynqKqkqHqvsdasZLCZpJi1br7Aqaeeql2juaZ5wqGmqaiRYrOtrdKhnKxlmJ7AbrDEmqNmrJ9irqXBy61krKyRp3q1scCnpZplpKfCrryMnayroZ6ceqytyGaanqaRqcButsCio2akmauytMDRnpimZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
