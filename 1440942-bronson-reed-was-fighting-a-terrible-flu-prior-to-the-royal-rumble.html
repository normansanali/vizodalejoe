Of course, their biggest one would be winning his or her first championship. Also, one of the moments that will forever be etched in their memories would be his or her Royal Rumble debut.</p><p>This past Saturday night, a handful of wrestlers got to experience their first Royal Rumble match. From Jade Cargill to Bron Breakker all <a href=#>had a strong showing in their respective Rumble matches</a>. Another star who competed in the Rumble for the first time was Bronson Reed.</p><p><a href=#>The Australian-born wrestler</a> had a decent run at the 37th annual Royal Rumble Premium Live Event. Following that, he went on to Monday Night Raw, where he wrestled ‘Main Event’ Jey Uso. Following the match, Bronson Reed took to Twitter to reveal that before the Premium Live Event, he was recovering from a terrible flu.</p><p>“I’ve been recovering this past week from a terrible flu. Being a part of the #royalrumble    brought me back to life. Bucket list. Oh and and I heard you chanting “MEAT!” Keep that energy going into #WWERaw  #yeetvsmeat,” Bronson Reed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-bronson-reed-is-excited-for-elimination-chamber-2024>Bronson Reed is excited for Elimination Chamber 2024</h2><p>This February, WWE will be making its PLE debut in Australia. It is the Elimination Chamber. Ahead of the Premium Live Event, The Collossal One <a href=#>shared his thoughts</a> on the event and is looking forward to competing in a WWE event in his home country.</p><p>“I am super excited. I always wanted to be a part of a WWE event in my home country. Now we have WWE Elimination Chamber, Perth. It means a lot to me. It’s almost a culmination of my whole career. I spent a long time in Australia, grinding on the Australian Independent Scene, hopefully trying to get eyes on the Australian wrestling scene. So to see an event like this in my home country, it’s going to mean the world not only to myself and the people in WWE from Australia like Rhea Ripley, and Grayson Waller, but also to all the wrestlers back home,” Bronson Reed&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtZ3JsYmKvs7vNrKanZaKasqV51pqqZp6ZnLW1tc2gZJplpJq%2Fs7XBpZxmnpyqerG%2ByKipZqyfYsGpsYyrprKZnGK%2FtrnBpZw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
