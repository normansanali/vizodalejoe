He wrote that the charge of possession of drugs, possibly synthetic cannabinoid, was dropped on January 2. The charge of possession of marijuana (not more than 20 grams) has been transferred to the County’s Misdemeanor Court Division.</p><p>Johnson also writes that her scheduled arraignment, which was set for February 12, has been canceled. He states that there will instead be a status conference related to the remaining charge on February 20.</p><p>Additionally, Johnson notes that the remaining possession charge is a first-degree misdemeanor in Florida. The maximum punishment is up to a year in jail or on probation, as well as a $1,000 fine. A conviction would also come with one’s driving license getting suspended for six months, random drug testing for the individual, and the reimbursement of related fees.</p><p>WrestleZone will monitor the situation and provide more information as it becomes available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsa2xxZ2K5prPApWSuqJSWwaZ5zqdkpaGmYrqwvsaapWaZlqmys3nDnpqepZKav26t0aucrKw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
