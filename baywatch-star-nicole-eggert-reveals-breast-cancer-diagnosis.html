I immediately went to my general practitioner and she told me I had to immediately go get it looked at. But the problem was I just couldn’t get an appointment. Everything was booked. So I had to wait until the end of November to get it done. This journey’s been rough for me. This hasn’t been a breezy sale through life.</p><p>“I always read inspirational quotes and corny stuff, but it gets me through.”</p><p>The former ‘Charles in Charge’ star – who has and Dilyn, 25, with ex-Justin Herwick as well as 12-year-old Keegan from a different relationship – needs to have surgery but is determined to fight the disease for the sake of her children, especially her youngest.</p><p>She said: “I can definitely feel it. It’s there. It needs to be taken out. So it’s just a matter of do I have to do treatment before the surgery or can they perform the surgery and then I do the treatment after.“I have panics where I’m like, just get this out of me, You sit there and it’s in you and you’re like, every second that passes and it’s inside of me.
