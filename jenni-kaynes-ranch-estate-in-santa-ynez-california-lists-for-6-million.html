She extended her fashion label into homeware in 2017 with a range of pillows, throws, slippers, and candles.</p><p>As a kid, fashion and home designer Jenni Kayne used to visit the Santa Ynez Valley with her family. “I have such amazing memories of summers and long weekends there,” says Kayne regarding the wine-growing region northwest of the city of Santa Barbara.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>Actress And Producer Sandra Bullock Lists Her Southern California Avocado Ranch for $6 Million</b></a></span></p><p>In September of 2020, Kayne purchased a 3,860-square-foot home in the valley — where celebrity residents have included Noah Wylie, Bo Derek, tennis great Jimmy Connors and lyricist Bernie Taupin — but the four-bedroom house was not exactly move-in ready, according to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/JenniKayne_SY3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I spent time looking for the right property in Santa Ynez, and came across this home that had been abandoned since the 1970s. It was near disrepair, with caution tape across the sinks and toilets and animals living inside,” says Kayne, who nevertheless could see the potential of the space as a showcase for her Jenni Kayne Home collection and as a place for friends and family to visit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/JenniKayne_SY4.jpg><p>“I took the property down to the studs with my team, opening up rooms, rebuilding and fulfilling its potential.” Renovation of the property took two years and was completed this past March.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/JenniKayne_SY5.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now Kayne is selling the 20-acre property, which the designer has dubbed the Jenni Kayne Ranch and which she describes as a classic “California ranch-style home optimized for indoor-outdoor living.”</p><p>The home slash marketing concept — which she showcases on her brand’s website with a “shop the ranch” buying feature of showcased items including her Pacific Bed and Brentwood Chair — is a study in comfy yet minimalist living done in white and beige tones. “We loved having the ability to showcase the power of our home collection in a living, breathing space,” says the L.A.-based designer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/JenniKayne_SY6.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Listed with Kayne’s husband, Westside Estate Agency partner Richard Ehrlich, for $5.99 million, the open-floor-plan house, which has 360 degrees views of the surrounding oak-dotted hills, includes a chef’s kitchen by bespoke kitchen designer Plain English and a pool surrounded by items from her outdoor furniture line, the Vista Collection.furniture line, the Vista Collection.</p><p>Over the summer and early fall, Kayne and her brand hosted experiential getaway weekends for guests at the property that included farm-to-table meals, wine tastings, yoga classes and spa treatments. Among those posting on Instagram about their stays were fashion blogger Aimee Song and stylist Brad Goreski.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/JenniKayne_SY8.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kayne, who published design book “Pacific Natural at Home” with Rizzoli last year, sees the property renovation as her “first big step” into the hospitality sector, with plans for a similar project in New Zealand in 2023. The designer, who last year launched a beauty line, Oak Essentials, is also partnering with the soon-to-open Auberge Resorts Collection property The Inn at Mattei’s Tavern. Located in Los Olivos in the Santa Ynez Valley, the resort will include her beauty line, plus spa treatments curated by Kayne.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Kanye West's College Professor Express His Thoughts About Anti-Semitic Controversy</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmajnZ6jtm63wLKlnqtdp66vr8dmnKyskamybrXNZqqapqSWerq6xLNknJmcnrOwvs2imGakmajBtHnFqKlmbl2itq24yKilaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
