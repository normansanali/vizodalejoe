While the launch from Newfoundland reportedly went well, the submersible seemed to have just vanished over the weekend. Now the race is on as the amount of usable air in the small vessel dwindles by the hour and so does the hope for a happy ending for this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">worrisome tale of the sea</a>. So who are the mysterious passengers of this small vessel? We dug deep to find out.</p><p data-characters=609 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>The RMS Titanic sank into the icy waters of the Atlantic in 1912. It was touted as “the unsinkable ship,” so its sinking understandably garnered a lot of attention. Due to the belief the ship was unsinkable, there simply weren’t enough lifeboats aboard. So, when it struck an iceberg and subsequently began sinking, many were plunged into the icy water. With the temperature below freezing and the only rescue over an hour away, 1500 people ended up losing their lives on that fateful night. The story captured the attention of the masses and the Titanic has held that intrigue to this day.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>Those with an adventurous spirit seem drawn to the wreckage of the great ship, and the group onboard the Titan is no exception.

However, the vessel and the brave explorers at the heart of this expansive search are now lost at sea.</p><h2 id=h-hamish-harding data-injectable=false>Hamish Harding</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Capt.
