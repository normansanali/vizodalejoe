According to the New York Times, Chesebro was the “key architect” of a plan to employ phony electors to rig the election, which is “the cornerstone” of the federal case against Trump.</p><p>Who is Kenneth? Is he married? Who is his wife? How much is his net worth? The bio attempts to cover it all here.</p><h3><strong>Meet Kenneth Chesebro, Trump Campaign Attorney</strong></h3><p>One of President Donald Trump’s lesser-known attorneys, Kenneth Chesebro, not only assisted in the creation of the so-called fake electors scheme that was at the center of alleged attempts to overturn the election results but also expressed doubt that it would succeed, according to a newly surfaced memo from Trump’s legal team that was published by the New York Times on Wednesday.</p><p>In the memo, dated December 6, 2020, Kenneth outlined his audacious plan to use fictitious electors. He urged GOP electors in six states that were in the race to support Trump to cast new ballots and submit them to Washington for a January 6 congressional certification that he had won.</p><p>According to the plan, former Vice President Mike Pence would either delay the vote count or prevent the confirmation of the election—which Pence refused to do—while Trump would “force” lawmakers, the media, and the general public to “focus on the substantive evidence of illegal election and counting activities in the six contested states,” Kenneth&nbsp;wrote.</p><p>Kenneth, however, admitted he was “not necessarily advising” that the strategy be implemented, and that “there are many reasons” why it might not work. Though he hasn’t initially charged or suffered the same fate as former Trump attorney John Eastman, the so-called “mastermind” behind the dubious fake electors’ legal theory, who is currently facing disbarment and is reportedly worried about being criminally charged in the Department of Justice’s case against Trump, he has received criticism for his role in the fake electors plot.</p><p>He has, however, received criticism for that role.</p><p>In March 2022, Kenneth was&nbsp;subpoenaed by the House January 6 committee in its investigation into Trump’s alleged efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 election. Along with Eastman, Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows, attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jeffrey Clark, and Trump himself, he was one of five Trump associates and attorneys who received a criminal referral from the committee in December as a result of its 18-month probe.</p><p>Now, according to the <a href=#>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>, he is facing seven charges: Violation of the State’s RICO Act, conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, conspiracy to commit filing false documents, and two counts each of conspiracy to commit forgery in the first degree and conspiracy to commit false statements and writings.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Kenneth Chesebro Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Kenneth Chesebro’s estimated net worth is likely above $20 million. He reportedly went through a stunning mid-life crisis after investing in Bitcoin, selling out four years later and making a fortune. It was around this time that Kenneth transformed his life, split with his wife, and bought a penthouse apartment at 230 Central Park South in Manhattan, where an adjacent penthouse “is currently on the market for $13.95 million.</p><p><a href=#>One story</a> about Kenneth shared, “Ken was a competitive debater in high school and college, at Northwestern, and when he arrived in Cambridge for law school, in 1983, he looked much as he does now: the same shock of brown hair flopping onto his forehead, the same aversion to eye contact.”</p><p>Following graduation in 1986, Kenneth relocated to Washington, D.C., to work for District Judge Gerhard Gesell, who would later become well-known for presiding over the Oliver North trial. According to his LinkedIn profile, he works for the US Department of Justice as Deputy Special Counsel, Office of the Independent Counsel for Iran/Contra Matters. However, Chesebro soon made the odd professional choice of returning to Cambridge, where he established a solo practice and frequently worked for Tribe.</p><p>But Ken soon moved back to Cambridge where he set up a practice as a solo practitioner, an unusual career move, where he often did work for Tribe.</p><p>“He maintained an enduring, puppyish devotion to Tribe, who still, on occasion, hired him to help with his cases,” the story reported. But mostly Chesebro did brief writing for plaintiffs in civil litigation, often in personal injury cases or class actions.</p><p>His LinkedIn profile says “Kenneth Chesebro has handled more than 100 cases in the <a href=#>U.S. Supreme Court</a> and lower courts, frequently on behalf of trial lawyers pursuing high-profile litigation against corporations.” Typically he represented Democratic plaintiffs. In 1993 Chesebro wrote a long article in the&nbsp;American University Law Review defending work for such plaintiffs and skewering “Reagan Administration ideologues and their colleagues in Congress.”</p><h3><strong>Kenneth Chesebro Age</strong></h3><p>Born in 1961, Kenneth Chesebro is 62 years old as of 2023.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Kenneth Chesebro Parents?</strong></h3><p>Kenneth Chesebro was the son of Marlene Chesebro and the late Donald J.
