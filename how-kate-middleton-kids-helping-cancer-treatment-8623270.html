Sources close to the Cambridges explained that the royal children are playing a vital role in Kate's recovery and showing "the extraordinary resilience of children" in the process.&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Prior reports</a>&nbsp;stated that Kate was getting plenty of help from her parents, with sources calling Michael and Carole Middleton, as well as her brother James and sister Pippa, the "anchor" of her life. Today, new sources shared that the kids are helping their parents with smiles and fun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You take heart from the extraordinary resilience of children," a friend of the family shared with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. They added that Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis "buoy [their parents] with smiles back."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Having fun together when they can is very important," the insider finished. "The children are at the center of their world."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kate's message, which was shared with the public last week, took her kids into account, as well. The princess reportedly&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>waited to make the public announcement</a>&nbsp;until after her children were out of school for Easter, giving the family time to process the news together. During her announcement, Kate said that she and William took time to "explain everything to George, Charlotte, and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them and to reassure them that I am going to be OK."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We now understand the logic of the timing — waiting for the children to break up from school. And she struck a pitch-perfect note," royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for William, royal sources note that he's also making sure Kate has everything she needs to recover.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He is a very reliable, strong person. She doesn’t feel isolated in this because of William, who is right beside her," a friend&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>previously said</a>. "This is about supporting her and her feeling supported. It is a joint effort. She doesn’t feel isolated at all. The nuclear family that they have created so well is an immense support not only to him, but to Catherine, too."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x6iuZqORqbJuucidm6WdpKS7brfInapmoJWhvaq6xmaamqaTmr9uwNGemK2llaPBboSVa2prb2A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
