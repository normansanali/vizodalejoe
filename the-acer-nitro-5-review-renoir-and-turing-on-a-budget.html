The Acer Nitro 5 achieved 397 minutes here, which is just over 6.5 hours. That is a far cry from the 12-15 hours we see on Ultrabooks, but still a solid time for a 45-Watt class gaming laptop.</p><p><img alt="Battery Life 2016 - Web - Normalized" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph16153/118465.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Looking at the normalized result, which removes the battery size from the equation, the Acer Nitro 5 gaming laptop does not manage to touch the smaller, lighter laptops in energy efficiency, but is not too far off either, despite the larger display and more powerful internals.</p><h3>PCMark 10 Battery Modern Office</h3><p><img alt="PCMark 10 Modern Office Battery" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph16153/118480.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The PCMark 10 test leverages some of the sub-tests from their performance workloads and runs them in sequence. Each test is given ten minutes to complete, so if a system gets the work done quicker it earns extra idle time. This test is actually less demanding than our web workload, due to the idle time, and scores are generally a bit higher. The Acer Nitro 5 did very well on this test, achieving just a hair over nine hours.</p><h3>Movie Playback</h3><p><img alt="Battery Life Movie Playback" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph16153/118464.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Generally, the least demanding task is video playback, since the video decode can be offloaded to efficient, fixed-function hardware in the CPUâ€™s media blocks. This is one area where AMD struggled in previous generations of the Ryzen laptop platform, but is another area where they have become very competitive. The Acer Nitro 5 managed almost exactly ten hours of runtime.</p><p><img alt="Battery Life Tesseract" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph16153/118467.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>If you are wondering how many movies that is, our Tesseract score divides the movie runtime by the length of a long movie- in this case The Avengers, and the Acer was able to playback the equivalent of The Avengers over four times.</p><h2>Charge Time</h2><p>Acer ships the Nitro 5 with a 135-Watt AC adapter, providing power to the system as well as charging. It connects via a barrel connector on the rear of the device, and the connector itself feels quite robust. If there was a knock against it, it is easy to put the plug in, but not actually connect it as it takes an extra push to click it in, but that does secure it nicely.</p><p><img alt="Battery Charge Time" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph16153/118466.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The system was able to go from 0% to 100% charge in about two hours, which is more or less average. Despite the high-power input, charging the battery at too high a rate would degrade the battery life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH53fZRsZq2glWKupLHRZqWirKKkenZ50Z6top2nYr%2Bmus6iqWaZnpl6tcHRoqWgZZ%2BjeqJ5wa6boJ2kZIM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
