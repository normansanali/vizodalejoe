That’s right. The series came out on March 24, 2006. According to <a href=#>IMDb Trivia</a>, Miley was only 11 when she auditioned for the show.</p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>It’s not great to think about how young and vulnerable she was when, as another IMDb trivia item lays out, “Once Miley Cyrus’s contract with Disney ended, she lost the right to perform any song specifically written for the show or the movie.” Miley, thankfully, seems to have done just fine despite having no legal rights to her early material, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">netizens have pointed out</a> that the contract likely never prevented her from doing live covers.
