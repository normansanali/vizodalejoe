In season one, Taylor confessed to the other housewives that Russell was verbally and physically abusive to her. Shortly after, she filed for divorce (via <a href=#>HuffPost</a>). With the weight of divorce, financial issues, and a pending legal case on his shoulders, Armstrong died of suicide on Aug. 15, 2011 at the age of 47.
