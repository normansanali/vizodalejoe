The YouTube power couple known as “Jerika” both got the word written in capital letters that are stacked vertically. She placed her tiny inking on her left forearm while he incorporated his much larger “GOAT” tattoo into a growing collection of intersecting words on his left thigh. They joked that Erika is a goat, as in the animal, while Jake is the GOAT, an acronym for Greatest Of All Time.</p><p>Goats are Erika’s favorite animal and have been since she was a child. She&nbsp;previously&nbsp;had the word “goat” tattooed inside her lip, though lip tattoos are known to wear off so&nbsp;it might be very faded by now. She <a href=#>explained</a>&nbsp;that her goat obsession all dates back to one special pet:</p><p>Why am I obsessed with goats? When I was 12 years old or so I had a pet goat. I loved this goat so much. His name was&nbsp;Twinklebuddy. I also had a couple other weird animals with weird names, but Twinklebuddy was my favorite and he actually died unexpectedly. I’ve been obsessed with goats my entire life. I don’t know where it came from — well I know it came from Twinklebuddy but it’s stayed with me all the way til right now. So that’s the reasoning behind everything goat. It also means Greatest Of All Time.</p><p><a href=# class=more-link><span aria-label="Continue reading ">(more…)</span></a></p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/erika-costell-roman-numeral-XII-tattoo-500x500.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>Twitter / @erikacostell; Instagram / @erikacostell</p><p>Erika Costell has the roman numeral XII inked on the left side of her chest.</p><p><a href=# class=more-link><span aria-label="Continue reading ">(more…)</span></a></p><h4>Similar Products:</h4><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/erika-costell-red-X-elbow-tattoo-500x500.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>PRPhotos.com; Instagram / @erikacostell</p><p>Erika Costell has a red&nbsp;<strong>“X”</strong> tattoo on her right elbow for Team 10, the YouTube house which she is a part of. X is the roman numeral for 10.</p><p>She hates how this tattoo looks and actually wanted to get it removed. In a vlog she explained why she was planning to get rid of it:</p><p>“Right now it’s a bittersweet moment. I love Team 10, but it’s time to get my Team 10 tattoo removed…because the guy who did my tattoo completely screwed it up. It’s uneven. The color is ugly. It was just a total fail…That’s my seventh tattoo and I’ve had no problems with any other tattoos and I just can’t get used to this one. I hate it; it’s poorly done.”</p><p>However when she arrived for her appointment at LaserAway they told her that their machines were designed for black ink and they couldn’t remove her tattoo because of the color. She was warned that the lasers could actually make the tattoo worse or cause scarring, so she left with the tattoo still on her arm.</p><p><a href=# class=more-link><span aria-label="Continue reading ">(more…)</span></a></p><h4>Similar Products:</h4><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stealherstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/erika-costell-ohana-foot-tattoo-500x500.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>PRPhotos.com</p><p>Erika Costell has a script tattoo on her left foot reading <strong>“Ohana”</strong> which is the Hawaiian word for “Family.” She got this tattoo along with her family back in November 2013 while she was home from college for a weekend.
