The sheriff’s deputies were called to the chicken restaurant over an accident with injuries.</p><p>The manager made an astounding revelation when he told the authorities that Miller’s order was corrected, and she received her biscuits before the incident, but Miller “was still not happy.”</p><p>According to the report, Miller’s action was not entirely unforeseen. Before the incident, the woman threatened the restaurant’s staff, even calling and threatening to drive her car into the building.</p><p>One of the employees, standing by the entrance, was almost struck by the car during the incident, noted deputies.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the incident report, a witness allegedly waiting in line with Miller was told to hurry and get their order “because she was coming back.”</p><p>Miller returned and allegedly drove her SUV into the chicken restaurant, narrowly missing an 18-year-old employee.</p><p>According to arrest warrants, Miller continued driving after hitting and entering the building until her car was stopped by debris.</p><p>After crashing into the restaurant, Miller fled the scene, according to the report. Her car was discovered at her home with front-end damage.</p><p>According to the Richmond County Sheriff’s Office, Miller was booked into the Charles B. Webster Detention Center on Wednesday, four days after the alleged incident.&nbsp;</p><p>No one knows what was going on in Miller’s mind when she did this, and it’s unknown if she feels any guilt or remorse after being arrested.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCzxKipoKGRYsSwucCnZJyqkai1pr%2BMrKyvZZmjwbB5z6innrGVqHqistOeqWaglad6sL7Dnqlmr5Goeq610qygp59dl7a0r9Siq6xn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
