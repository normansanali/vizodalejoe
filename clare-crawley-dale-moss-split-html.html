On September 30, she shared a snap of herself holding the hands of her mother, writing a long caption that briefly read: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I hate that I even have to say this, but in response to all the questions that are coming my way right now … I’m choosing not to speak right now on the details of my relationship, because at the end of the day anyone can put on an ACT or throw words together to form any narrative they want...</p><p>In the caption, she also revealed that she was going through a lot emotionally and&nbsp;physically for other reasons, too, including the recent&nbsp;breast implant removal surgery and her mother being hospitalized due to a bad health condition.</p><p>The social media personality claimed that her energy was currently focused on&nbsp;grieving, healing, and being present at home in Sacramento.

During the season, the former football wide receiver went down on his knees to propose to&nbsp;Crawley, after less than two weeks of filming. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The former couple had their engagement and subsequently traveled to different places, including Hawaii, as an engaged couple for vacation.</p><p>But very soon, the romance headed south as they <a href=# rel=follow>briefly ended separated&nbsp;in January 2021</a>. "We appreciate the love and support we've received from so many people, but this is the healthiest decision for both of us at this time," Moss wrote on Instagram at the time.</p><p>One month later, they&nbsp;reconciled, only to separate again in September. This time, it seems like the relationship has ended once and for all.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuclr%2BmecKrmLCkla56pa3LnmSmp6OoerS8y6KrZ6Ckork%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
