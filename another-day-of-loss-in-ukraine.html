But there is nothing routine about life near the front line in Ukraine.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city and a short drive from the Russian border, lives with the low thunder of distant artillery and the sickening booms of shells exploding much closer to home.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Natalia Kolesnik, like other residents, learned to live with the risks. Then, in a grassy courtyard on a hot and sweaty Thursday, the shelling caught her.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">She was one of three bodies on the littered ground.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">One body appeared unrecognizable. A second, with a torn yellow dress and a blue slipper blown off, lay beside a splintered wooden bench. Next to it, there was a box of half-eaten fruit, cherries and apples, speckled with blood.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Inside a purse left on the bench, a mobile phone rang.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Kolesnik was nearby.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Her husband, Viktor, arrived in shock. He didn’t want to let her go. He stroked her head.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“Dad, that’s it,” his son Olexander said, watching as first responders waited to close the body bag. “She is dead. Get up.”</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“Don’t you understand?” his father asked.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“What don’t I understand?” the son said. “This is my mother. Dad, please. Dad, please.”</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Kneeling, Viktor embraced what was left of his wife, one arm cradling her shoulder, his stubbled chin pressed against the grit on her face.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">He picked up her left hand and placed it again, covering it with his own.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">The pleading continued. Viktor again shoved his son’s hand away.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“Dad, go.”</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“I can’t go.”</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“Look, you are covered with blood. People need to carry her away.”</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Viktor began to close the body bag himself, then the first responders took over.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">As neighbors watched from the edge of a field, and as authorities began their now-routine hunt for shrapnel, Viktor was left alone on a bench to cry.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“Why were these people killed? Terrible. I’m sick of it,” neighbor Sergey Pershin said. “Every night we wake up 10 times and wait when they start shooting. What are these bastards doing? There are residential buildings here. Why are they shooting here? There is nothing here.”</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">It was just one day in Kharkiv, where hundreds have died in 19 weeks of war. As Russia reassembles its troops to try to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine, it is safe to say more dead are to come.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">As of Sunday, the United Nations human rights office had verified at least 4,889 civilians killed across Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, a number it said likely represented a vast undercount.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">___</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Follow AP’s coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</p><p>Copyright 2022 The Associated Press.
