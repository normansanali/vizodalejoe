When a creature with first strike attacks or blocks, it deals damage before creatures without first strike. If a creature with first strike and deathtouch deals damage to a creature, even just 1 point of damage, it will be enough to destroy that creature.</p><p>Here are some commonly asked questions about how first strike and deathtouch interact:</p><h3>1. Can first strike kill a creature with deathtouch?</h3><p>Yes, a creature with first strike will hit before the deathtouch creature has a chance to deal damage. If the first strike creature deals damage to the deathtouch creature, it will be destroyed.</p><h3>2. Can a creature have both first strike and deathtouch at the same time?</h3><p>Yes, a creature can have both first strike and deathtouch abilities. These abilities work together, allowing the creature to deal damage before creatures without first strike and to destroy creatures it damages with just 1 point of damage.</p><h3>3. How does deathtouch and first strike interact in combat?</h3><p>If a creature with deathtouch is blocked by a creature with first strike or double strike, the deathtouch creature will deal damage during the regular combat damage step. However, the creature with first strike or double strike will deal damage during the first strike damage step, potentially destroying the deathtouch creature before it has a chance to deal damage.</p><h3>4. Is deathtouch similar to first strike?</h3><p>Deathtouch and first strike are distinct abilities with different effects. First strike allows a creature to deal damage before creatures without first strike, while deathtouch causes any amount of damage dealt by a creature to be enough to destroy the target creature.</p><h3>5. Does first strike deathtouch negate trample?</h3><p>No, first strike and deathtouch do not directly affect trample. However, if a creature with trample and deathtouch is blocked by a creature with first strike, the blocking creature can potentially destroy the attacking creature before it can assign trample damage to the defending player or planeswalker.</p><h3>6. What is deathtouch?</h3><p>Deathtouch is an ability that causes any amount of damage dealt by a creature with deathtouch to be enough to destroy the target creature. It is a powerful ability that can eliminate creatures with high toughness or indestructible.</p><h3>7. Does indestructible negate deathtouch?</h3><p>Yes, indestructible creatures are immune to destruction, so deathtouch does not affect them. Indestructible creatures can block or be blocked by creatures with deathtouch without being destroyed.</p><h3>8. How does first strike work against indestructible creatures?</h3><p>First strike allows a creature to deal its combat damage before creatures without first strike. However, indestructible creatures are not destroyed by damage, so they can survive combat with creatures that have first strike.</p><h3>9. Who wins in a battle between first strike and deathtouch?</h3><p>A creature with first strike will hit first and potentially destroy the deathtouch creature before it has a chance to deal damage. In order for deathtouch to be effective, the creature with deathtouch must hit first.</p><h3>10. Does hexproof protect against deathtouch?</h3><p>No, hexproof does not protect against deathtouch. Hexproof prevents a creature from being targeted by spells or abilities your opponents control, but deathtouch does not target the creature when dealing damage.</p><h3>11. Does deathtouch beat protection?</h3><p>Yes, deathtouch can overcome protection. If a creature has protection from a source, it cannot be damaged, enchanted or equipped by that source. However, deathtouch does not cause damage in the traditional sense, so it can still destroy creatures with protection.</p><h3>12. Can deathtouch kill a creature with indestructible?</h3><p>No, indestructible creatures are immune to destruction, so deathtouch does not destroy them. The damage dealt by a creature with deathtouch to an indestructible creature has no effect on whether the creature is destroyed.</p><h3>13. How does first strike work against creatures with deathtouch?</h3><p>A creature with first strike will hit before creatures without first strike, including those with deathtouch. If a first strike creature deals damage to a creature with deathtouch, the deathtouch creature will be destroyed.</p><h3>14. Does deathtouch work if combat damage is prevented?</h3><p>Deathtouch requires the creature with deathtouch to deal damage to another creature. If combat damage is prevented, the creature with deathtouch will not deal damage and its ability will not activate.</p><h3>15. Can first strike creatures with deathtouch be ninjutsuâ€™d after dealing first strike damage?</h3><p>Yes, creatures with first strike and deathtouch can still be returned to your hand using ninjutsu after dealing first strike damage. The ninjutsu ability can be activated during the first-strike combat damage step.</p><h3>16. Is double strike better than first strike?</h3><p>Double strike combines the effects of both first strike and normal combat damage, making it superior to first strike in terms of dealing damage. A creature with double strike deals damage both during the first strike combat damage step and the regular combat damage step.</p><h3>17. Does indestructible prevent counterspells?</h3><p>Indestructible creatures can still be targeted by counterspells. Counterspells do not destroy creatures, they simply counter the spell or ability being cast. Indestructible only prevents destruction, not being targeted.</p><h3>18. Does hexproof protect from board wipes?</h3><p>No, hexproof does not protect from</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWgmrGqrY6dpp6rXZu2s7%2FTZqqtqpmgsm7DzquiZq%2BZqbVusMSaq6Gsn6qwqXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
