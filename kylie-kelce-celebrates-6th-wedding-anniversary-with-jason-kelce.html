It all lead me to Winnie and holy sh*t did she live up to the hype. She was everything I had hoped for in a wolfie and more.”</p><p>She added: “I lost part of my soul today, but I know she is at peace. I love you, Winn. You will always be my first born child.”</p><p>Kylie and Jason also share another Irish Wolfhound, Baloo, and are parents to three daughters: Wyatt, 4, Ellie, 3, and Bennett, 13 months.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Jason-Kelce.jpg><p>After meeting on Tinder, the former Eagles Center tied the knot with Kylie in Philadelphia on April 15, 2018 — yet their path to the altar was anything but smooth sailing. In September 2023, <a href=#>Jason recalled</a> getting too drunk and falling asleep during the couple’s first date on his and <strong>Travis Kelce</strong>’s “New Heights” podcast. However, Jason still knew that he had met the love of his life that night.</p><p>“[I] definitely fell asleep,” Jason said on the podcast. “Got a little too inebriated, but I was sober enough to know [she] was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen in my life. It was love at first sight. … I didn’t [believe in love at first sight] until I met [her] and it was like fireworks exploded at the door the moment she walked into Buffalo Billiards.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the midst of anniversary celebrations and the loss of a beloved pet, the couple is also still grappling with Jason’s retirement from the NFL after 13 years with the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>Jason <a href=#>tearfully announced</a> his retirement during a March 4 press conference, during which he thanked Kylie for her support, recalling their Tinder meet-cute. He also thanked the city of Philadelphia, right outside of which he, Kylie and their three daughters call home.</p><p>“It has always been a goal of mine to play my whole career in one city. I couldn’t have dreamt a better one and a better fit if I tried,” he said. “I don’t know what’s next, but I look forward to the new challenges and opportunities that await, and I know that I carry with me the lessons for my time here and that forever we shall all share the bond of being Philadelphians.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaksZyesm63xKWanmWTmrmmrtGaq56rXWvBqXnWnpudoZ6ceqK6zaKtnqqjlr%2B6edaiq6FlmpbAsLqMpJylm5Vk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
