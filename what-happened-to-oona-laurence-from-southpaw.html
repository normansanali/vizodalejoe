The movie — about a boxer who is forced to redefine his identity after the death of his wife — was produced on a budget of $30 million, but had to endure a few blows of its own before it was completed. At one point, for instance, <a href=#>production had to be halted</a> after the main actor was injured during one of the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite this and other challenges, Southpaw turned out to be a resounding success, both critically and commercially. The $30 million production budget came back as $94 million in box office earnings, with fans and critics singing the praise of the film. Gyllenhaal played the central protagonist in the story, with <a href=#>The Notebook star Rachel McAdams</a> featuring as his wife.</p><p>Few stole the show as much as child actor Oona Laurence, however, who portrayed Leila Hope, the daughter of Gyllenhaal and McAdams’ characters. The young actress had not turned 13 when the movie was released, although many other child actors before her had already proven that age is just a number.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jake Gyllenhaal Got Absolutely Ripped For His UFC Movie, Here's How He Did It</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gyllenhaal himself was just about the same age when he first started acting professionally.

Before playing the role of Leila Hope, she had already built a name for herself in the entertainment industry. She made her professional acting debut at the age of ten in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Broadway production of Matilda the Musical</a>, where she played the lead role of Matilda Wormwood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Laurence’s performance was critically acclaimed, and even won her a Tony Award: she shared the “Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre” with her castmates Sophia Gennusa, Bailey Ryon and Milly Shapiro. She also earned a Grammy nomination (also collective) for “Best Musical Theater Album.” Following her success in Matilda the Musical, she continued to showcase her talents in various productions, including Lamb, I Smile Back and an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Strict Rules These Child Actors Had To Follow On Movie Sets</a></span></p><p>Southpaw was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">written by Sons of Anarchy creator Kurt Sutter</a>, who had originally wanted Eminem to play the part that went to Jake Gyllenhaal.

It helps, of course, in scenarios where real-life parents replicate the same role with their real-life children in a movie or a TV show. Yet even in such situations, things might not always go smoothly.</p><p>A good example is this of Jaden Smith, who starred alongside his father Will in The Pursuit of Happyness and later on After Earth. While the first of those two movies was a sensational success, <a href=#>Will had to teach his son how to deal with failure</a> when the second flopped.

These experiences have gone on to serve her really well as she continues to further her acting career.</p><p>After Southpaw, Laurence went on to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">star in the critically acclaimed film Bad Moms</a> in 2016. The movie, which also starred Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell, was a box office hit and received positive reviews from audiences and critics alike. Laurence played the role of Jane Mitchell, the daughter of Kunis’ character Amy Mitchell. Her performance in the film was once again praised for its emotional depth and range.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bad Moms was so successful that a sequel — A Bad Moms Christmas — was released in 2017. This too, really resonated with audiences, and the film raked in more than $100 million at the box office. Laurence once again reprised the role of Jane Mitchell. Other than her work on the big screen, the actress has also appeared in a number of TV productions.</p><p>Since 2018, she has been voicing Hedgehog and a number of other characters in Cartoon Network’s Summer Camp Island.
