And why wouldn’t he be? Comedians tend to do well in serious roles, and so far, the actor hasn’t faced any controversies.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hear me out <a href=#>https://t.co/QOg8QxlPF0</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/z1xtwBx7HJ</a></p>— The Green Kasey (@RawbertBeef) <a href=#>April 30, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=729 data-injectable=true>While most people took this fan cast very seriously, some realized what @RawBertBeef was referencing when they shared the photo of Hill in their post. For those who don’t recall, there was a scene in the 2015 film, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ted 2</a> where it was revealed that Hill was going to be the next Superman in 2016. This news didn’t please Mark (played by Mark Wahlberg), expressing his disappointment immediately after the announcement.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>Even OP had to clarify to others that this tweet was a reference to the comedy sequel after the hate they’ve received.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is a Ted 2 reference.</p>— The Green Kasey (@RawbertBeef) <a href=#>April 30, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>Even if this post was a joke, who wouldn’t want Hill as Superman? According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a>, the actor was seen surfing and looked “nearly unrecognizable” when spotted in Malibu. Also, the actor voiced Green Lantern in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The LEGO Movie</a>&nbsp;and played Titan in Dreamworks’&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Megamind</a>. He may not be everyone’s first choice, but he does have some qualifications to play the role.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>Gunn revealed that the actor to play Superman should be someone&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“younger looking,”</a>&nbsp;as well as be&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">compassionate, kind, and someone you would “want to give a hug.”</a>&nbsp;And at the moment, an official shortlist of potential actors has not yet been revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGaklZvBbrLInqOdZaOqvaa%2BzJqlZqSVnK6kxYycmKysmaO0bq%2FAp5uinJGpsm6w0ZqurGWgp7KktdKeo7JlpJ2ybr7ErKeopqOaerq71J1knrCgmrC1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
