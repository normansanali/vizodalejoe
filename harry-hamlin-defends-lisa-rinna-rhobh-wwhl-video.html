He also sided with his wife for confronting <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Garcelle Beavuais</a>&nbsp;</strong>at the Season 11 reunion for never thanking Harry for giving her a jar of his Spaghetti Bolognese sauce.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Harry defended Lisa, again, when Andy asked about her social media behavior.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<i><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mayfair Witches</a>&nbsp;</i>star even called out Andy for referring to Lisa’s online antics as “disastrous.” “Come on. That’s not fair,” Harry said. “It’s not disastrous. She’s fantastic online. Her social media is great. What are you talking about?,” he added, before confirming that he doesn’t even follow Lisa on Instagram.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Harry also defended Lisa for her role in the rumors that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Yolanda Hadid</strong></a> had Munchausen’s Syndrome. “She didn’t actually do that,” he explained. “She was given this book and was asked by another cast member to make mention of this word. But then she took the fall.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Harry-Hamlin-Defends-Lisa-Rinna-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>As fans know, we won’t be seeing Harry Hamlin on&nbsp;RHOBH again since Lisa <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>just left the show</a> after eight seasons. The reality star <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>confirmed her departure</a>&nbsp;via email to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> following a turbulent season 12.&nbsp;“This is the longest job I have held in my 35 year career and I am grateful to everyone at Bravo and all those involved in the series.&nbsp; It has been a fun 8-year run and I am excited for what is to come!” Lisa&nbsp;said of the run, which began back in 2014.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Lisa has since chatted with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Interview Magazine</a> and confirmed that her exit from the series is <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>not a “pause.” </a>“I think everything&nbsp;Housewives&nbsp;has to go away for a while, which is good,” she said. “It’s time for a break. Not a pause, I don’t go on pause,” Lisa added. “You <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>don’t put me on pause</a>.
