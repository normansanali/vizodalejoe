But holy f’ing balls I am overwhelmed as hell – today I lost my voice screaming at my kids for, well, for being kids. I had to check myself before I wrecked myself: I packed an overnight bag for them and dropped them off with my (angel!) parents.”</p><p>“I drove home crying the whole way partly because I feel like a horrible mom, partly because I have so much to do and I’m overwhelmed beyond belief, partly because I’m purging money, partly because I’m so sad to be leaving the home I picked out and built with hopes for the family that never really was, and partly because I’m exhausted from not sleeping,” the blogger added. “I went home, took a nap now I’m sharing this with you as I cry again – and I’m feeling sorry for myself bc I wish I had a partner on whose shoulder I could cry. Things are gonna be fine but today was heavy. Change is hard. I’m strong, I’ll persist. But I need a minute to feel the feels.”</p><p>King’s heartfelt post came less than a week after she confirmed her breakup with Schauf, 39, after six months of dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Meghan-King-Ex-Christian-Schauf-Sets-the-Record-Straight-After-Their-Split.jpg><p>“They say all good things must end but I don’t believe that,” the former Bravo star wrote in <a href=#>an emotional blog post</a> on Monday, November 30, after Us Weekly reported that they’d <a href=#>ended their relationship</a>. “After a terrible split from my ex-husband I learned how to heal. I then met and dated a wonderful man: Christian. We laughed, went on adventures, made a long-distance relationship a thing of beauty, grew together, and then … well, we grew apart.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in May that King had moved on with the Uncharted Supply Company CEO after her October 2019 separation from Edmonds after five years of marriage.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Schauf told the New York Post‘s Page Six on Monday that the split wasn’t caused by the fact that King lives her life in the spotlight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/127368636_222021009272646_1799266500781046318_n.jpg><p>“I’ve never had any problem with any form of publicity. <a href=#>We lead very different lives</a> and knew that when we met,” he said. “Sometimes this happens.”</p><p>He added, “I wish nothing but the best for Meghan and the kids, and we’re on good terms.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamnZedrq95yqKloGWjlsa0echmrqKrmGK2brTAnWSaZaCWv7W6xKtkmp6kmr9ur8eroKysmZa7br%2FCoZiunl2ova2102g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
