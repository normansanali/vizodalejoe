That certainly seems to be the case for some celebrity couples who hit the gym together.</p><p>In any case, besides strengthening their relationships with extra time to bond as they sweat their way through jogs, yoga classes or HIIT sessions, these power couples are strengthening their already amazing bodies. Sometimes, they even pick up tips from the other’s fitness regimen!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>, for example, has always stayed in great physical shape. But during her relationship with former professional baseball player <a href=#><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong></a>, which began in 2017, she really stepped up her exercise game. A-Rod introduced her to his longtime trainer <strong>Romero Dodd</strong>. Since then, she traded in her mostly cardio workouts for weight lifting circuits, focusing on muscles and strengthening. And it’s clear that she’s never looked better.</p><p>“Everyone does resistance training, but she’s more being sculpted, meaning, every exercise she does is for a purpose and a reason,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dodd told Us Weekly</a> in January 2019. “There’s a lot of things that we don’t do because it would make her look masculine or boyish or maybe over-muscular. My formula is more like art work. I look at things that need to come off and things that need to be added.” Continued the pro, “My philosophy is tiny and tight. My goal is to make her tiny and tight — not bigger and bulky.”</p><p>Lopez and Rodriguez called off their engagement in 2021. She has since rekindled her romance with <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a> — and kept her eye on the workout prize, hiring <strong>David Kirsch</strong>.</p><p>“Whether you’re working with Jennifer Lopez or with someone else, there’s an old Biblical phrase that says, ‘look, listen and teach’, which are very powerful words,” the trainer told Vogue in November 2021. “It’s all too easy to put a series of exercises together in a cookie-cutter way. Before you go out and try and impress a client, you want to listen, observe and see what they need, plus what they want and are willing to commit to.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jana Kramer</strong></a>, for her part, decided to start training for a marathon following her divorce from <a href=#><strong>Mike Caussin</strong></a> and new romance with <strong>Ian Schinelli</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Just pushed myself for the first time in over 13 years. That’s how long it’s been since I ran 5 miles. I am pushing myself this year to not only chase joy but to stretch my limits and believe I can do anything,” she wrote in January 2022 via Instagram. “So each month I said I’m going to have a goal to chase joy and challenge myself. Well I had on my goal list one month to run a half marathon but I looked at it and thought I can do a half..I’ve already done a half(though it was 13 years ago)….a full would be a challenge. So as scary as it is I’m gonna run a marathon this year. And I’m TERRIFIED as I just barely got through 5 miles😂 but it’s not my strength that’s gonna be the issue. It’s my head. I live my life so afraid of things and hold myself back because of my ‘anxieties’ in work, life and love. But not anymore. This is gonna be the BIGGEST mind challenge but I have to try.”</p><p>Scroll through to see photos of hot and sexy stars exercising together:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNktbC4y7KuqKeUqHquu9KtZJ%2BhpGKwprjEm6mirKlisLDBz6WcrGViZX50fpNuZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
