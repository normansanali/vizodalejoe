Collin had other plans with his friends this weekend, that’s why he is not in the picture (shame I have to explain all that, but I just did)!!!!”</p><p>Conrad posted pictures on her own account, writing, “Happy 4th of July!! Missing Collin who dissed us for his friends.”</p><p>Jon welcomed Hannah, Collin and their sextuplet siblings Aaden, Joel, Leah and Alexis in 2004 with his now-ex-wife, <a href=#><strong>Kate Gosselin</strong></a>. The former couple are also the parents of twins Madelyn and Cara, 19.</p><p>Following their split, Jon and the Kate Plus Date star, 45, were granted shared physical custody of their kids.

Thank you so much Colleen love you so much!!!”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see pictures of Jon with Hannah and&nbsp;Conrad on the 4th of July.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkt7C6jKCmrKuVobavedahsGahXZm2pbrTZqqpnZ6ZenXAx2amn2Waqrm6edaiq6Flo6S7bq%2FOpaOipl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
