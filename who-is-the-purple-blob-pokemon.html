However, if made to laugh, it can’t maintain its disguise.</p><h3>Can a Ditto fight a Ditto?</h3><p>If a Ditto encounters another Ditto, the resulting fight is a little different. They will wiggle around until the secondary move, Struggle, is used. Eventually, one of the Dittos will win the fight.</p><h3>Why is Ditto so special?</h3><p>Ditto is special because it is invaluable when it comes to breeding.
