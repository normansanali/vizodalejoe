That’s when he put the car in reverse, running over the lieutenant.”</p><p>The unidentified officer suffered a back injury and bruises to his elbows and knees, and was taken to NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn for treatment, according to sources.</p><p>About 90 minutes after the 3:30 a.m. incident on Rockaway Parkway near Willmohr Street in Brownsville, Newson allegedly broke into a house in Far Rockaway, Queens, where his girlfriend and her mother have been living in the basement.</p><p>After allegedly terrorizing a 66-year-old woman and her son, the ex-con and reputed member of the Edgemere Crew gang allegedly stole a green Jaguar S-Type sedan whose owner left it running nearby to warm up before heading to work, sources said.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">After the incident where the NYPD officer was dragged by the car, he was taken to NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn with some injuries.</figure><p>Newson was finally captured by cops in Suffolk County, Long Island, and faces charges that include assaulting a police officer, according to the NYPD.</p><p>He was nabbed at his father’s house, sources said.</p><p>Newson was free to allegedly embark on the crime spree because rookie Queens Judge Denise Johnson denied a prosecution request to lock him up without bail after cops tracked him to his mother’s house in Rocky Mount, N.C., and busted him in a Valentine’s Day bar shooting in Queens.</p><p>During Newson’s April 7 arraignment in that case, his defense lawyer said $50,000 bail would be appropriate but Johnson — who was rated “not approved by the city Bar Association before her November election — released him without requiring him to post surety.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Police body camera footage showed an officer being dragged by a car the NYPD pulled over.</figure><p>In a prepared state, Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said, “Judge Denise Johnson’s reckless decision to release this perp without bail almost got people killed — including a cop.”</p><p>“She has demonstrated she is unfit to serve on the bench. But the problem doesn’t end there: the state’s dangerous new bail laws paved the way for this travesty of justice,” he added.</p><p>“Every lawmaker who voted for those laws must explain what they’re doing to stop this from happening again.”</p><p>Lynch’s remarks came after NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted Friday afternoon</a> that detectives were “AGAIN searching for Takim Newson after he used a car to assault a police officer early this morning.”</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Takim Newsom, a noted gang member, allegedly pulled the officer with the car.</figure><p>A spokesman for the state court system declined to comment beyond referring back to an earlier statement that said Johnson believed “that “the least restrictive form of bail as is required by the law, was supervised release.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpp6xpruMrJ%2Bor6NiwamxjKampp2eqXqvxc%2BdZJynoGK2tHnDq5ign5WZeqPFjJpknJmiYrGztdWepWaaqWKzs7HEnWSgmZ6ceq6xzJucq2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
