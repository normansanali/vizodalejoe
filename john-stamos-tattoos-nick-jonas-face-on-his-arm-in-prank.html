On Friday, March 15, the Full House star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted an Instagram</a> of him seemingly getting the youngest member of the Jonas Brother’s face tattooed to his arm. “#jobrosforlife,” he joked in the accompanying caption.</p><p>For those who need a quick refresher, the hilarious back and forth started when the “Sucker” singer wore a sweatshirt with a printed shot of Stamos wearing a Jonas Brothers shirt on it back in February 2019. He posted the paparazzi picture of him in the sweatshirt on his Instagram on March 2, writing, “It’s your move @johnstamos.”</p><p>The 55-year-old actor took the bait posting a picture of him sleeping on a pillow with the image of Nick in the sweatshirt. “I had the craziest dream last night…” he captioned the shot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/John-Stamos-Ups-His-Prank-War-With-Nick-Jonas-By-Tattooing-His-Face-On-His-Arm-02.jpg><p>Then when the 26-year-old singer grabbed that image of the 55-year-old actor sleeping on the pictured pillow and screen printed it onto a giant comforter, Stamos escalated the joke to involve permanent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ink</a>.</p><p>Nick commented on his Friday Instagram post writing, “Okay… okay…” His older brothers even chimed in with Joe leaving a series of crying-laughing emoji faces and Kevin in awe, writing, “No way!!!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Stamos is reportedly a fan of the boy band and has been spotted in their concert t-shirts during different outings and events for years. However, it’s hard to believe he actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">permanently marked</a> his body with the youngest member’s face. But he does tag Corona, California tattoo Studio Treble Art Studio as the location and Marisol Preciado as the tattoo artist.</p><p>She even posted a screen grab of Stamos’ pic to her social media page, writing, “Sooooo this happened @johnstamos @nickjonas.”</p><p>It seems unlikely that Nick will be able to top this wild tattoo, but we’ll just have to wait and see!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2B8qbqMrKuapZ%2BoerWt062mqKtdo7akt4yjpqeZo2Kzoq%2FEZqanZZiewG6t0aZkoqZdpb%2Biuspo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
