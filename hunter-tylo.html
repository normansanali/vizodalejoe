She stands 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs roughly 65 kilograms. Similarly, she is 35-24-35 inches tall, wears a bra size of 40C, and wears a size 9 shoe (US). Her brown hair is also brown, and her blue eyes are blue.</p><h2>Career</h2><p><strong>Hunter Tylo</strong> made her film debut alongside Daphne Zuniga, the Melrose Place actress, in the sorority slasher ‘The Initiation.’ She was credited as “Deborah Morehart” at the time. She later rose to prominence as a regular on soap operas such as Melrose Place. ‘All My Children,’ her debut TV series, premiered in 1985. However, due to her marriage to her co-star Michael Tylo, she is sacked from the show in 1988.</p><p>Similarly, she played Marina Toscano in ‘Days of Our Lives in 1989. It was a nasty character who caused problems for Steven “Patch” Johnson and Kayla Brady, the show’s most popular couple. Tylo later revealed that everyone, including herself, despised the persona. Despite the producers’ claims that they will do something to her character, they never did. Despite this, she hated returning to work for the final few weeks of the program before leaving in 1990 after her character was killed off.</p><p>She was later cast in the part of ‘Dr. Taylor Hayes’ on ‘The Bold and the Beautiful’ in 1990. She first refused to take the position because she was frustrated by her lack of success in soap operas. She had previously intended to stop acting and enroll at Fordham University in the Bronx, New York, with the goal of becoming a pre-med student. Later, while still obtaining her degree, she became involved in The Bold and the Beautiful in 1990.</p><p>As a result, she eventually gave up and began her career on the show. She then went on to complete her pre-medical degree. In the same year, she appeared as ‘Senora Del Reynoso’ in an episode of ‘Zorro’ titled ‘Family Business.’</p><p>In 1994, she played Messua Shandar in the television miniseries ‘The Maharaja’s Daughter.’ She appeared in two episodes of ‘Burke’s Law’ that year as Ingrid Rose and Penelope Jordan, respectively. She was cast as Heather in an episode of ‘Baywatch,’ titled ‘Windswept,’ in 1996. She also appeared in ‘Diagnosis: Murder’ as Claire McKenna.</p><p>She also returns to ‘The Bold and the Beautiful’ right away. ‘Making a Miracle,’ her autobiography, was published in 2000 and details her tribulations, including the infamous legal battle, her daughter’s cancer diagnosis and remission, and her son’s death. On the ‘New York Times Best Sellers’ list, it rose to number 35.</p><p>Later, in 2003, she guest-starred in ‘She Spies’ as Dr. Marks. In the year 2004, she played Billie Jeeters in the TV film A Place Called Home and June in the film They Are Among Us. In addition, she played Amelia Lockhart in the film Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy, which she starred in in 2005.</p><p>In the 1996 primetime soap opera Melrose Place, she was set to play Taylor McBride. However, before any filming could begin, the opera’s producer, Aaron Spelling, sacked her. She was sacked because she revealed that she was pregnant at the time.</p><p>Tylo sued the producer for discriminating against her pregnancy, and a Los Angeles jury awarded her $4.8 million. Similarly, her case is widely regarded as one of the most important instances of establishing rights to privacy and the ability of a pregnant actress to work.</p><h2>Hunter Tylo Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Hunter Tylo</strong> has amassed a sizable net worth as a result of her hard work and dedication to her job. Her net worth is estimated to be over $13 million as of November 2023.

To date, she has been married three times. In 1980, she married Tom Morehart for the first time. Christopher “Chris” Morehart is the name of the couple’s kid. Her first marriage, however, ended in divorce in 1984. During her first marriage, she was seeing an American actor called Jon Hensley.</p><p>Second, in 1987, she married Michael Tylo, an actor. She and Michael have two daughters, Izabella Gabrielle and Katya Ariel Tylo, and a son, Michael Edward Tylo Jr. Katya had retinoblastoma, a rare cancer of the eye that was discovered in 1998. The damaged right eye was removed and chemotherapy was started. A tumor was discovered in Katya’s other eye later that year, but it mysteriously disappeared. Katya is currently recovering and wearing a prosthetic right eye.</p><p>Her second marriage, sadly, ended in 2005 as well. Tylo also lost her son, Michael Tylo, Jr., on October 18, 2007. In Henderson, Nevada, he drowned in the family pool. His death, according to the Clark County Coroner, was caused by “drowning related to epileptic disorder” and was deemed accidental.</p><p>In addition, in 2006, she rekindled her relationship with American actor Lorenzo Lamas. They split up the following year. She dated Corey Cofield again in 2008, however, the relationship ended in divorce. Tylo went so far as to file a restraining order against Cofield, alleging that he was abusive towards her and her children.</p><p>Gersson Archila is her current husband. They married in a private ceremony in Las Vegas, Nevada, on November 29, 2009. The couple has been together for the past seven years and appears to be quite happy together. Similarly, the couple married shortly after Tylo’s mother, Joanne Hunter, died.</p><p>She is currently free of speculations and controversy in both her personal and professional lives. She, on the other hand, is content with her life.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifrqakmr9uwNilpmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
