This restriction means that celebrities are unable to attend film premieres or discuss any films or TV shows they‚Äôve been a part of on social media, in interviews, or during conventions. For example, the cast of Christopher Nolan‚Äôs <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oppenheimer</a> left the U.K. premiere to stand in solidarity with their colleagues.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>However, unlike <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Amell</a>, who stated last weekend that <a href=#>‚Äúhe does not support protesting,‚Äù</a> Levi‚Äôs complaints deal with existing work that has already been released. His comments sparked a divide between fans and critics. Some argue that it‚Äôs unfair that existing work cannot be acknowledged, while others claimed that promoting previous work still benefits struck companies financially.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Zachary Levi now complaning about the SAG strike's rules. i know no one's surprised but how does this guy manage to be so annoying all the time üíÄüíÄ<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6V5bRQdyjS</a></p>‚Äî ‚ùì‚ùì0‚ùì (@comicxbook) <a href=#>August 4, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>You'd be surprised.
