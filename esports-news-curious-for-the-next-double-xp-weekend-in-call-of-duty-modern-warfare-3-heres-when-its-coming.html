In any game that requires XP to level up, players would love to get more XP faster to level up sooner. But MW3 has its challenges. But there’s need not worry anymore. Double XP is coming soon in order to help players level up weapons and&nbsp; with overall progression.</p><p>Similar to all other COD games, the devs are working on introducing Double XP weekends in the latest entry as well, on a consistent basis. And it seems like it’s ready for the next XP-filled weekend which is happening very soon.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Next Double XP weekend in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 officially announced</h2><p>Having XP points in COD is an ultimate boon for players.

So naturally, players love an XP weekend. And the next Double XP Weekend in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 has been announced.</p><p>The devs recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal the dates for the much-anticipated XP weekend. Players of Modern Warfare 3 will witness the Double XP weekend starting from November 22, 2023 at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT. However, COD players will have to make the most of the Double XP weekend in order to progress faster. The XP weekend will last only for five days. It will eventually end on November 27, 2023.</p><p>Thus, it becomes crucial for most of the users, especially the casual gamers, to take advantage of the XP weekend. Otherwise, it will take longer for them to accomplish significant achievements and challenges for their desirable unlockable items. Hopefully, the presence of Double XP will keep those players busy who are irritated by the game’s issues regarding certain aspects. For instance, despite the removal of some problematic maps causing bad spawns, the current spawn system still needs more improvement.</p><p>Then, there’s the situation related to ‘Evil Groot skin’ from Modern Warfare II.
