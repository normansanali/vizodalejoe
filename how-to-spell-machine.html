It is a tool or invention which multiplies the effect of human effort. Often a <b>machine</b> will change one form of energy to another form of energy. <b>Simple machines</b> increase or change the direction of a force.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-a-human-a-machine></span>Is a human a machine?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>However, the body is not a <b>machine</b>. <b>Machines</b> have discrete parts with specific functions connected to each other in straightforward ways. Bodies have parts that may have blurry boundaries and many functions and the parts are often connected to each other in ways hard for <b>human</b> minds to fathom.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-machine-a-full-form></span>Is machine a full form?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Answer. There is no <b>full form</b> of <b>machine</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-machine-and-types-of-machine></span>What is a machine and types of machine?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>By means of a <b>machine</b> an applied force is increased, its direction is changed, or one form of motion or energy is changed into another form. Thus defined, such simple devices as the lever, the pulley, the inclined plane, the screw, and the wheel and axle are <b>machines</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-computer-a-machine></span>Is computer a machine?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A <b>computer</b> is a <b>machine</b> that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Modern <b>computers</b> can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable <b>computers</b> to perform a wide range of tasks.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-invented-machine></span>Who invented machine?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Charles Babbage designed <b>machines</b> to tabulate logarithms and other functions in 1837.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=has-time-machine-been-invented></span>Has Time Machine been invented?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The idea of a <b>time machine was</b> popularized by H. G. Wells’ 1895 novel The <b>Time Machine</b>. It is uncertain if <b>time travel</b> to the past is physically possible.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-3-greatest-inventions-of-all-time></span>What are the 3 greatest inventions of all time?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Greatest Inventions In The Past 1000 Years<table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th><b>Invention</b></th><th><b>Inventor</b></th></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>1</td><td>Printing Press</td><td>Johannes Gutenberg</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>2</td><td>Electric Light</td><td>Thomas Edison</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0><b>3</b></td><td>Automobile</td><td>Karl Benz</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>4</td><td>Telephone</td><td>Alexander Graham Bell</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-invented-the-time></span>Who invented the time?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The measurement of <b>time</b> began with the invention of sundials in ancient Egypt some <b>time</b> prior to 1500 B.C. However, the <b>time</b> the Egyptians measured was not the same as the <b>time</b> today’s clocks measure. For the Egyptians, and indeed for a further three millennia, the basic unit of <b>time</b> was the period of daylight.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-time-a-man-made-concept></span>Is time a man made concept?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Time</b> as we think of it isn’t innate to the natural world; it’s a <b>manmade</b> construct intended to describe, monitor, and control industry and individual production.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-time-a-human-concept></span>Is time a human concept?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Isaac Newton said that we are merely occupying <b>time</b>, he also says that <b>humans</b> can only understand relative <b>time</b>. Relative <b>time</b> is a measurement of objects in motion. The anti-realists believed that <b>time</b> is merely a convenient intellectual <b>concept</b> for <b>humans</b> to understand events. <b>Time</b> is not an empirical <b>concept</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-invented-words></span>Who invented words?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The general consensus is that Sumerian was the first written language, developed in southern Mesopotamia around 3400 or 3500 BCE. At first, the Sumerians would make small tokens out of clay representing goods they were trading. Later, they began to write these symbols on clay tablets.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-worlds-longest-word></span>What is the world’s longest word?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis<p>Appearing in the Oxford English Dictionary, this 45-letter <b>word</b> for a disease is the <b>longest</b> English <b>word</b> that is defined in a major dictionary.

But the oldest written <b>language</b> that is still in actual use would probably be Chinese, which <b>first</b> appeared around 1500BC…<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-oldest-cuss-word></span>What is the oldest cuss word?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Fart, as it turns out, is one of the <b>oldest</b> rude <b>words</b> we have in the language: Its first record pops up in roughly 1250, meaning that if you were to travel 800 years back in time just to let one rip, everyone would at least be able to agree upon what that should be called.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-swear-a-bad-word></span>Is swear a bad word?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Profanity is a socially offensive use of language, which may also be called <b>cursing</b>, cussing or <b>swearing</b>, <b>cuss words</b> (American English vernacular), <b>curse words</b>, <b>swear words</b>, <b>bad words</b>, <b>dirty words</b>, or expletives. Accordingly, profanity is language use that is sometimes deemed impolite, rude, or culturally offensive.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-made-swear-words></span>Who made swear words?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>We don’t know how the earliest speakers of English swore, because it wasn’t written down. Before the 15th century – which is when <b>swearing</b> first appeared in writing – most writing was done by monks, and they were too good, and their work too important, for them to write down <b>swear words</b>.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6tLzEpaNmpZGYtaq6xGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
