And extremely complex, layered, pressurized, so many things. For now, we’ve just decided that it would probably be in our best interest to be moving through the world unromantically. We’re OK and we want you guys to be OK. And we just wanted you guys to know, just because we’re not together in a romantic relationship, doesn’t mean that we can’t work on a very meaningful, deep connection and relationship. I will always love this human so much.”</p><p><strong>Chris</strong> added, “When we started doing social media, we had only been together for seven months, and we also were just doing it for fun. It wasn’t like we got a TikTok and were like ‘Let’s get a job. Let’s make this our whole entire lives.’ And it just kind of happened that way. When you’ve only been together for seven months, you don’t even know each other that well. So, to suddenly be shipped as this, like, perfect amazing couple—who, if we ever were to break up, people aren’t going to believe in love—was just like a lot pressure.”</p><p><strong>Chris</strong> said that while fans didn’t mean to “put that pressure on,” it was still there.</p><p><strong>Ian</strong> said, “Life happens and being in this public eye is crazy. So, we just kind of ask for some privacy, some support. We’ll still be in each other’s lives and we’ll still be in your guys’ lives together, separate. So, new season.”</p><p></p><p><span>Just Jared on Facebook</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJmgwbC3jKyrmqqjYrCpvsisZKiko5q7brXAp2SpmZeawW6x16mjmqGeYsSprdNmo56cXam8bsDHnqCrZZKnsqK31Klm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
