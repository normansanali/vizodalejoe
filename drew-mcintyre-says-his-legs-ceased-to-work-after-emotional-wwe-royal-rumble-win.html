I think I managed a couple of turns and my leg just gave out on me.”</p><p>“I could see the people on the floor trying to tell me to go in the corner with the cameraman and I was like, ‘I can’t.’ I was like, ‘Leave me alone I’m just having a moment here.'”</p><p>“That moment when I collapsed in the ring. That was the moment when everything went rushing through me. The journey. The ups and downs the sacrifices, my family, my wife you know have made to along with me. I got emotional. People give me crap for crying — I’m not crying — I got tears in my eyes — I get emotional. You know I’m human it all just hit me at that moment. Obviously, it was overwhelming as I saw a piece of The Chronicle that was filming afterward. I’m sure they’ve got more because it was absolutely surreal in the moment in front of the crowd, but especially backstage when it started setting in.”</p><p>Drew McIntyre and Vince McMahon shared a special moment of gratitude backstage which <a href=#>was captured on camera.</a></p><p>We’ll have to see if Drew McIntyre will defeat Brock Lesnar on April 5th. <a href=#>McIntyre said if he doesn’t win his fans will riot.</a> At least he had an amazing experience at the Royal Rumble that he will never forget.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>If you use the quotes in this article credit<a href=#> Ringside News</a></p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
