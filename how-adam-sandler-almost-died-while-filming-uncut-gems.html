Well, in the film, Sandler's character Howard Ratner gets pretty roughed up by guys he owes money to. When it came to filming the scene, Sandler was left gasping for air. According to <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>, the stunt ended up going wrong when a cue was missed.</p><p dir=ltr>Director Josh Safdie explained to EW how it all went south. During the stunt, Sandler got choked by his co-star. But the actor quickly realized he couldn't breathe and tried to tap out. Unfortunately, Sandler's co-star thought the actor was still in character as Howard and actually choked him harder. The stunt coordinator ended up coming to Sandler's rescue before things got taken too far. "A safe word? He couldn't speak!" Safdie said. "But he never said anything till after we cut and then he was like, 'Thank you.'"</p><p>Talk about suffering for your art, but that wouldn't be the last time Sandler narrowly escaped death in the past few years. In January, TikTok and Twitter users perpetuated that Sandler died in a viral hoax, according to <a href=#>the U.S. Sun</a>. Fortunately, Sandler was very much still breathing, though he would go on to get injured on a movie set again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmhna4V3e8eormaZlJa6br%2FAp5ulnaJirq25zqyrZpyZmrFuw8eio55llp65rrXNoGSuppOqwW6zxKaqaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
