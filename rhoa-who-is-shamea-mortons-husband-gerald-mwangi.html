According to his <a href=#>LinkedIn</a>, Mwangi enrolled at East Carolina University. After graduating in 1999, he made his way to Atlanta, where he has been ever since. "He and his siblings came to the States for college. So he's been in the States right before his 18th birthday," Morton told the <a href=#>Daily Dish</a>, adding. "He's like, 'No, I never want to leave Atlanta.'"</p><p dir=ltr>Since landing in Atlanta, Mwangi has worked hard to build a name for himself and become a successful businessman. Mwangi, who holds a degree in Construction Engineering Management, landed his first role as a project manager at an HVAC company. He eventually rose through the ranks to become vice president. In 2009, he left that role and became the CEO of a mechanical contracting firm. His LinkedIn also lists a role as president of Dominion Energy Management.</p><p dir=ltr>Other than his work history and his relationship with Morton, there's not much info available on Mwangi, as he's pretty quiet on social media. In his free time, though, he likes to unwind with a little jazz and exercise. "I play either Racquetball or Football in my spare time," he's quoted as saying on <a href=#>his website</a>. "To recuperate from the long day of work, I take sanctuary in the world of Jazz."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampjaoF6f46rn6iZXay1sHnIrGSsoJGisqJ5zKipraeeqHqpwdKbmKecXZyys63LnWSmr5GjtKp7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
