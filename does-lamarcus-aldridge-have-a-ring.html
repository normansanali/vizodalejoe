The Chicago Bulls selected him second overall in the first round of the 2006 NBA Draft. Aldridge, who had a 16-year career with the Trail Blazers, San Antonio Spurs, and Brooklyn Nets, is one of the best power forwards in recent memory.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There is no denying Aldridge's statistical accomplishments. He boasts a 19.1/8.9/2 per-36-minute line to go with strong shooting efficiency for his career. He is 35th all-time in Field goals, 46th all-time in scoring,58th all-time in rebounding, 64th all-time in blocks, and #65 with the most minutes played.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Assessment of His Prospects</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>LMA had plenty of chances at a championship during his career. He was a perennial All-Star, and he had his share of playoff success in the Western Conference, with one trip to&nbsp;the WCF&nbsp;while leading the Portland Trail Blazers. His subsequent move to the San Antonio Spurs in 2015 would only further confirm that fact as a </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>key</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> piece of championship-level teams.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His Tools</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Aldridge displayed his strengths as a big who could bang inside or hit the mid-range game throughout the way. He had an effective mid-range game and could dominate inside for several teams.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Legacy Talk</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Aldridge's career in the NBA will be remembered only for how highly skilled and permanently great he was. Even though he never won an NBA title, his legacy as one of his era's most talented big men is still very much intact. Not winning a championship ring is another layer of complexity to how we think about him, not something that de-legitimizes his place in the sport.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>While the basketball world looks back at his playing career following news of his retirement, Aldridge's impact will still be felt on the court for years.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In the grand scheme, LaMarcus Aldridge's legacy extends far beyond not having an NBA championship ring to his credit as he enters retirement with eternal status in basketball lore.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfmbymv4ylmKaZopjCtHnApZuroZScsm60wK%2BcZpldp7avsw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
