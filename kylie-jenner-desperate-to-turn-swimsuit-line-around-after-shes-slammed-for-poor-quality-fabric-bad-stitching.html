I don’t understand. Once I move, everything’s gonna be out. I would never wear this in public.</p><p>“They are the most unpractical swimsuits you could buy.”</p><p>93 Playstreet swimwear founder&nbsp;Jessica Anderson&nbsp;also called out Kylie for the line’s lack of “integrity,” stating on <a href=#>TikTok:</a> “I am completely and totally disappointed that this is completely see-through.</p><p>“I’ve seen behind the scenes of what it takes to produce swimwear, and the fact that no one caught this blows my mind.</p><p>“For me, it comes down to lack of integrity as a business owner and an entrepreneur.”</p><h2><strong>TURNING THINGS AROUND</strong></h2><p>The pregnant KUWTK star and momager <a href=#>Kris Jenner</a> are taking the criticism into serious consideration, as the source said: “She and Kris are having emergency meetings about what they can do to turn things around.”</p><p>“Kylie is concerned enough over the status of each of her current lines,” the insider added.</p><p>The informant concluded: “This is supposed to be a time for Kylie to relax, enjoy her pregnancy and plan for the upcoming holidays.</p><p>“Instead, she’s questing whether she’s taken on too much — and worrying about the bad vibes affecting her baby.”</p><h2><strong>MORE BACKLASH</strong></h2><p>Kylie- who is currently expecting her second child with boyfriend <a href=#>Travis Scott</a>, 30- was recently slammed for her <a href=#>“disturbing” graphic photo shoot.</a></p><p>The couple already share three-year-old daughter Stormi.</p><p>In the photos and clips,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kylie</a>&nbsp;was drenched in the fake blood and covered her from head-to-toe in smears.</p><p>While wrapping her arms around her body, she gave a serious look to the camera while sitting on a white floor with pools of “blood” gathered around her.</p><p>The bizarre photo shoot was to promote Kylie Cosmetics’ Nightmare on Elm Street line.</p><p>After Kylie shared the strange promo shots and clips, one critic commented: “This is kind of disturbing especially since you’re pregnant. But that’s just my opinion.</p><p>“I’m a mother of two baby girls, so for me it was disturbing seeing this but like I said it’s just my opinion which obviously doesn’t matter.</p><p>“I’m a nurse and worked in IVF, saw so many women go through miscarriages etc. The blood looks so real and knowing she’s pregnant makes it weird but yeah just my opinion.”</p><p>Another added: “It’s crazy to normalize such a thing especially when you think about women who actually end up like this in tragic events.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000686113419-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000678799822.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000559080716.jpg><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Kylie Jenner slammed for selling ‘poor quality’ swimsuits as fans complain of ‘bad stitching’ and ‘see-through’</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnm665qrGMo5ynppWneqWx0qmcq5mkmnq1u4ytrKumXajEqrnSrqCtZZyeu6Z5wKumrqaUYq6nwMSrZKyglah6tLjApqSenF2bvLN5z6imq2Whqq6ttdOyZJ%2BZkqe2pHnBmptmq6SewaS0yKeeaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
