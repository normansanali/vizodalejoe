On becoming a father, Hugh told People TV’s Jess Cagle: "It was the nicest thing that's ever happened to me - he said sounding clichéd - but it happens to be true." He continued: "It's just lovely to have all that love around. Suddenly you love someone more than yourself. It's unheard of in my case and they love you and it's all enchanting."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9bb5ed320197-hugh-grant-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ea-P4F8-nFE8 data-wc=4><strong>Hugh has five children</strong></p><p id=ev5ceVWe80Zt data-wc=44>The star continued to speak of a funny game he likes to play with his sons.

Speaking to TV host <a class=hm-link href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a> about fatherhood back in 2012, Hugh said: "Everyone was right all these years, saying, 'Hugh, why don't you have some children? It changes your life'. Now that I have a child, it is life-changing. I recommend it. Get some!"</p><h2>Where does Hugh Grant live?</h2><p id=ew0eT_YVpT7d data-wc=34>According to , Hugh bought a six-bedroom semi-detached home in London's Chelsea area at the end of 2018.
