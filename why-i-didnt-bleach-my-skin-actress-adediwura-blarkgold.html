I do not want to lose my self-pride, self-esteem, and self-dignity. I’m a role model to the younger ones in my family and I chose to lay a good ex ample, especially to the ones that are girls.”</p><p>“I belong to the black race and we are proud of our color. Lastly, I respect God and appreciate the skin color he chose for me. Don’t forget that everyone has a choice about how they want to look.”</p><p>“A fulfilling life comes from following one’s creative and emotional desire and having a certain level of comfort. People have different desires and tolerances. Therefore, some actors will be more fulfilled than others. I am 30 percent fulfilled. It is a long journey and I am not halfway there.”</p><p>The curvy actress also stated that she would never opt for cosmetic surgery. She said, “I can never go under the knife for cosmetic surgery. Even to take injections, I scream and panic before taking them. The needle scares me to the bone. At 43, I have no regrets and I have never made mistakes in my relationships, either past or present.”</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-read-also-reactions-after-21-year-old-girl-40-year-old-mother-offer-themselves-freely-to-naira-marley-to-ch0p><a href=# rel=noopener>READ ALSO: <strong>Reactions After 21-Year-Old Girl & 40- Year-Old Mother Offer Themselves Freely To Naira Marley To Ch0p&nbsp;</strong></a></h4><p>“Some people expect celebrity marriages or relationships not to last but break-ups happen daily, whether one is a celebrity, pastor, or an ordinary human. Whatever will be will be. That it works for ‘A’ does not mean it will work for ‘B’. I don’t put my nose in people’s lives. I would rather go to their social media pages and appreciate whatever they post. I care less about how they got it (property they posted). That’s because I do not live with them. I do not know their worth and I do not monitor their bank accounts.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfsmWZYrGqsM2tZJuklZawqXnMsmSso5mjeqKv06ucrKtdlrGmsMiwrKuZXZe5or7KoKalnF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
