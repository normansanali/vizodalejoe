Some might call it a Napoleon complex, it [his age] gives him some [confidence] because he is so mature. He's a brainiac… well I think so, naturally," Parker, 45, said while promoting her new flick, Sex and the City 2 (out Friday).</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: How much the SATC 2 clothes cost</a></p><p>"'He's not quite tiny – that's on my husband's side – well, actually Matthew is average… not in personality or in intellect…. no, no, no, no, no," Parker continued, immediately trying to backtrack after she realized her backhanded comment.</p><p>"Let me clear this up. For the record, not in personality, intellect, charisma, talent, genuine likeability, well the list could go on and on," added the actress, who donned turquoise and black Nicholas Kirkwood shoes.</p><p>Parker then dug her hole deeper.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: What Carrie and the girls looked like in the 80s</a></p><p>"Anyway he's average in height as I understand so the odds of our son being average in height and weight is perhaps promising," says Parker, who is 5-foot-3. Her husband, 48, is 5-foot-8.</p><p>Parker later joked that her boy had already been accepted to MIT. Quipped Letterman, "Even with an average father!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Shaking her head, Parker said, "How am I ever gonna fix this?"</p><p>This isn't the first time Parker has inadvertently insulted her husband of 13 years, with whom she attended the SATC 2 premiere and after party Monday night. She forgot to thank him in a long-winded Emmys speech in 2004 in which she mentioned dozens of other people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoqBirqSvyJ2cp6yRobm6ecKao6WrXZ3CtK7Ap5tmpZGpwamx1maZq6eUmr%2Bqr8pmmK%2Bdopa0pnmRaWhpamZqfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
