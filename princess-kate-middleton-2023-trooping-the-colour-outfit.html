In 1748, King George II decided to throw an annual military parade in June so that he could celebrate his birthday, which falls in November, in good weather. Thereafter, the second Saturday of June has become known as the reigning monarch's official birthday.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today's parade will see the military procession migrate from Buckingham Palace, down The Mall to Horseguard's Parade.
