The reason?</p><p>"She changes 12 times a day; it's insane," the designer-stylist told the publication, adding that though he's loosening his reigns on work with Gaga, he'll always be there to support her.</p><p>"She's going to be my BFF forever, but my ex-assistant Brandon [Maxwell] is heading that project," he said. "I'm too busy with [other commitments]. I've done two albums with her, it's been like five years, and you know, I'm always going to be involved somehow, but I cannot do it every day."</p><p>Formichetti, who was the creative genius behind several of Gaga's most memorable looks — including the meat dress she wore to the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards — is instead focusing his attention on his responsibilities to Uniqlo and Diesel. The 36-year-old was recently named the artistic director for the latter label.</p><p>"I live between Europe, America and Asia," he continued. "I've terminated my other jobs to concentrate on Uniqlo, and … I still have time to do lots of other things."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gaga's upcoming album, ARTPOP, is being billed as a multimedia "project," not just a musical collection, the singer told WWD <a href=#>in a recent profile</a>.</p><p>"The point [of ARTPOP] is that art and pop can have an exchange," she said. "[I'm not] defined by the same designer or defined by the same hair cut or defined by the same icon. The statement is that I'm not one icon. I'm every icon."</p><p>"I'm an icon that is made out of all the colors on the palette at every time," she added. "I have no restrictions. No restrictions."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmZSueqitxpqqZqSfo7S1tcyeZKysqaG2tMCMqqyirKNiwKmxjJyfmqaXmsBufZFmq6Kllah6onnDmrBmamBmgHiEjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
