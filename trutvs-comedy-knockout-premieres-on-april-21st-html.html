Comedy Knockout will make its series premiere on Thursday, April 21st at 10:30pm. Here’s more on the show from truTV’s press release:</p>Comedy Knockout pits comedians against each other in a series of fast-paced challenges, with the audience having sole discretion to decide who is the funniest person in the room. In each of the 10 half-hour episodes, host Damien Lemon (Guy Code) sends three comics into a battle of high stakes comedic gameplay. With points doled out based on the audience’s applause, it’s all about one-upmanship as competitors attempt to land massive comedy blows and whip the rowdy crowd into a frenzy of raucous laughter. The whole time, the comedians throw roast-like, rapid-fire jabs at each other to knock their opponents off balance. Every show ends with one comedian crowned champion, one eliminated and one ultimately forced to face the crowd and apologize for going down in shameful defeat. Guest comedians this season will include Jim Norton, Sherrod Small, Kevin Barnett, Jamie Lee and many more.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5p5ch05s0gu84sut27jby@published data-word-count=39>In addition to Comedy Knockout, truTV will also air a late night block of short-form comedy called Late Night Snack beginning on Thursday, March 3rd at 11:00pm. Here’s the current rundown of series that Late Night Snack will feature:</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz5p5ch05s1gu84c6xzlxau@published data-word-count=644></p><strong>Alec Baldwin’s Love Ride:</strong> Renowned International Relationship Expert Alec Baldwin takes surprised but game couples for a ride in his office/limo, learning their stories and providing them with hilarious (and sometimes poignant) relationship advice. Alec’s famous & funny friends also join in the action, following the star and his “Love Ride” closely behind in a separate car and offering their own advice in Alec’s unending quest to save all relationships on Earth. <strong>Austin Martinez Comedy:</strong> New York-based comedy duo Molly Austin and Shamikah Martinez create original characters and songs with topics ranging from manliness to how much of that marijuana brownie you should really eat. <strong>Benjamin the Cat:</strong> Human-sized cat mascot Benjamin the Cat made his debut on Impractical Jokers and has since become a fan favorite. Now in his own series of shorts, fans follow Benjamin’s exploits as he tries holding down a real person job in an office filled with humans – something he quickly learns is easier said than done. <strong>Celebrity Storytelling (working title):</strong> A series of animated shorts during which famous Hollywood actors, comedians and musicians recall (and often disremember or completely fabricate) the greatest childhood stories, fairy tales and literary classics of all time. The celebrities struggle to recall well-known literary tales completely from memory, with their recollections brought to life through an assortment of unique animation styles. <strong>Cocktales with Little Esther:</strong> A chat show in which comedian Esther Povitsky sits down with a group of fellow female comics for a fun and silly chat about our often awkward relationship with sex. <strong>D-Sides:</strong> It ain’t easy running D-Sides, a failing record store that boasts one of the rarest collections of long-lost and never-before-heard records from the world’s most famous artists. And when a rival hipster record store moves in next door stealing D-Sides’ business, best friends and owners, Neil (Neil Hopkins, Lost) and John (John Forest, Young Adult), make a play to save their store. Each week they unveil a rare gem (D-side) in the form of a music video that will blow any music lover away. <strong>Found Footage Files:</strong> Childhood friends, lifelong video collectors and VHS purists Joe Pickett (The Onion) and Nick Prueher (Late Show with David Letterman) report on location from the site of their favorite VHS finds. Thrift stores, storage lockers and public access stations serve as the backdrop as the duo introduces clips from these long-lost video relics, telling the stories behind the tapes and offering up their comedic observations from over 20 years in the video trenches. <strong>Passive Aggressive History:</strong> A comedic look at defining moments in history through the imagined petty conversations of the legendary individuals who lived them. Whether it’s the infighting crew of the Apollo 11 or the frenemies of colonial Salem, the series chronicles every eye roll, backhanded compliment, and clench-toothed smile behind the iconic events that shaped our world. <strong>Reign of Terror:</strong> Written by Kathreen Khavari and Chuck Neal, this short follows a roundtable discussion of several eclectic characters – all played by Khavari – that keeps veering off-track. <strong>The Screen Test:</strong> From Edmond Hawkins, a comedy where actors are misdirected and pushed to extremes on an audition that, unbeknownst to them, will be used as the final product of a televised comedic short. <strong>Don’t Be That Guy (with Tripp & Tyler):</strong> Based on a handful of sketches called, “Don’t Be That Guy,” the series follows Tripp & Tyler as they make some of life’s easiest situations difficult. How far will Tripp go to get the perfect Instagram photo of his latte? How many different tactics does Tyler have up his sleeve for getting out of a boring conversation at a party? All of the sketches are highly relatable to most normal people who find themselves alive in America in 2016. <strong>Hope and Randy (working title):</strong> A quirky, irreverent, romantic comedy about the sweet and awkward sexual explorations of a pair of 24 year-olds in their first serious relationship. <span class=ambrose-short-hed>truTV’s ‘Comedy Knockout’ Premieres on April 21st</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlob2dgZ3y1vtStraxlk6S6prDYZqKnp5OgvLbAjKmpnqWZmr%2Bmv4yopWaZoKe2rXmRaqqtZpipuq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
