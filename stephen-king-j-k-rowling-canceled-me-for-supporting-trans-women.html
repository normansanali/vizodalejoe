Trans women are women,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">King responded</a>&nbsp;— much to the ire of the “Fantastic Beasts” author.</p><p>“Here’s the thing: She is welcome to her opinion,” King told the Daily Beast of Rowling’s much-maligned messages.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image alignright size-nypost-medium-post is-resized">Stephen King’s tweet <span class=credit>Twitter</span></figure><p>“If she thinks that trans women are dangerous, or that trans women are somehow not women, or whatever problem she has with it — the idea that someone ‘masquerading as a woman’ is going to assault a ‘real’ woman in the toilet — if she believes all those things, she has a right to her opinion,” he insisted.</p><p>But “what she got angry about” was “my opinion,” King said, suggesting his fellow wordsmith had been hypocritical.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image alignleft size-nypost-medium-post is-resized">J.K.

I just felt that her belief was, in my opinion, wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>“We have differing opinions, but that’s life,” he said.</p><p>He also insisted that Rowling’s “opinion on trans women is an outlier in her entire political spectrum.”</p><p>“She’s on the side of the angels in most respects, but she does have this one thing that she’s very vehement about. No doubt,” he said.</p><p>King also <a href=#>bucked the trend </a>and came out in support of cancel culture.</p><p>“All that’s happening here … is that the way they’re used to doing business no longer works as well as it used to,” he said in the interview.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">J.K.
