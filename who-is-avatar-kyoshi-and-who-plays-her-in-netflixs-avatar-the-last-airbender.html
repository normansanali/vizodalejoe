She was known as a fierce warrior and was said to be 7 feet tall. Before her death she molded a group of warriors in her image (the Kyoshi Warriors), who also play a vital role in the series. Basically, she was a bad-ass.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>But what was really Avatar Kyoshi’s story? And who plays her in Netflix’s Avatar: The Last Airbender? Read on to find out!</p><h2 id=h-who-is-avatar-kyoshi data-injectable=false>Who is Avatar Kyoshi?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Avatar-The-Last-Airbender-Kyoshi-and-Her-Girlfriend.jpg><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>Kyoshi was born in the Earth Kingdom to a pair of criminals: Jesa, a runaway Air Noma nun, and a thief named Hark. While they were not great parents, they did leave Kyoshi with her metal fans and her famous face paint, so in that way their legacy lives on. The pair eventually abandoned her and she was left struggling as a homeless orphan, having to eat out of the garbage and scavenge for survival.</p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>When the masters Jianzhu and Kelsang came to her village in search of the new avatar, Kyoshi watched from the sidelines. Eventually, she was called up and passed one of the tests: Recognizing a relic that had belonged to a previous avatar. However, her traumatic upbringing had led her to be untrusting, and before she could undergo more tests she ran away. However, the air nomad Kelsang had an inkling that she was special, and so became her defacto caretaker.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>As he was away often, Kelsang paid farming families to look after Kyoshi when he wasn’t around, but he soon realized many were taking his cash and not feeding her. As a result, he found her a position at the Avatar Mansion, a large structure that was being made so that the new avatar could have a place to practice and perfect their bending.</p><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=832 data-injectable=true>For most of her childhood it was believed her wealthy acquaintance (and later good friend) Yun was the avatar. As she grew into her role, Kyoshi became more trusting, and even made some friends, most notably the firebender Rangi. During this time, Kyoshi developed more of a peaceful, turn-the-other-cheek persona, taking the bullying of others in her stride even though it was within her power to destroy them. She even stopped practicing earth bending, believing it useless to her.</p><p data-characters=623 data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true>However, this idyllic and easy life soon came to an end. Kelsang had long suspected that she was the avatar, and it was soon revealed that the orphan servant girl was the real deal. This led to a horrific confrontation in which she lost Yun to a spirit, and Kelsang was murdered by Jianzhu. Kyoshi escaped from the horror, and ended up travelling around with a group of criminals, before eventually taking on the Master Jianzhu, who had grown even more power hungry. However, she didn’t strike the final blow: that was left to Yun, who had returned to avenge himself against Jianzhu for abandoning him to the spirits.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>After Jianzhu was defeated, the Earth Kingdom fell into disarray as a leadership vacuum filled the space he’d previously taken. This, plus a few other traumas, shaped her view that only justice and force could bring peace, and as a result she was happy to use her powers to kill those she perceived to be upsetting the balance of the world. She soon revealed herself to be the avatar, and began taking on the necessary duties.</p><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>During her time as avatar she stopped the dangerous Yellow Neck uprising, subdued Fire Lord Zoryu as he attempted a massacre, and famously defeated Chin the Conqueror, who had planned on taking the Earth Kingdom by force. She eventually founded Kyoshi Island and the Kyoshi Warriors to keep that region of the world safe, while also pushing reforms in the Earth Kingdom that turned it into a constitutional monarchy. She was also known for helping the poor, which is unsurprising given her background.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>She lived until 250, making her the longest living avatar. During most of her life there was peace, but her actions did cause some problems. The largest was the fact she helped to form the Dai Li, the Earth Royal Family’s elite fighting unit, who were used to commit evil during and after her lifetime.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why is Avatar Kyoshi important in Avatar: The Last Airbender?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Avatar-Kyoshi.jpg><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>Avatar Kyoshi is important for many reasons in Avatar: The Last Airbender. As she is a former avatar, Aang is a reincarnation of her. This means she is able to contact him and give him advice, which is sorely needed for the young, isolated airbender.</p><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=788 data-injectable=true>Additionally, the microstate of Kyoshi Island which she founded, and her group of fighters the Kyoshi Warriors, play a vital role in the series. Aang and his team end up on Kyoshi Island early on in both the animated and live action series, and with Kyoshi’s help Aang is able to control the avatar state for the very first time. Additionally, Suki, the leader of the Kyoshi Warriors, becomes a love interest for Sokka and also helps the gang later on in the series, playing a vital role in their eventual defeat of Fire Lord Ozai.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>One final important role that Kyoshi has is acting as a more serious foil to Aang and his predecessor (her successor) Roku. The latter two are both very easy going and excel at the more diplomatic elements of being the avatar, but their fair-mindedness is often taken advantage of by unscrupulous forces.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who plays Avatar Kyoshi in Netflix’s Avatar: The Last Airbender?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Yvonne-Chapman-Kyoshi-1.jpg><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>In Netflix’s live action version of Avatar: The Last Airbender, Kyoshi is played by Yvonne Chapman.
