While the absence of gloves may raise concerns about hand injuries, BKFC fighters have developed techniques and strategies to minimize the risk of breaking their hands.</p><p>Origin and Transition to Gloves Bare-knuckle boxing originated in 17th-century England and followed a set of accepted rules. However, in the late 19th century, the sport transitioned to using boxing gloves to reduce the severity of injuries. This change was primarily driven by concerns over fighters suffering from hand fractures and torn skin.</p><p>Tight Fist and Targeted Strikes To minimize the risk of hand injuries, BKFC fighters make a tight fist and aim their strikes at specific target areas. By targeting areas like the groin, liver, solar plexus, ribs, nose, chin, jaw, temple, or side of the neck, fighters can avoid hitting hard surfaces that may cause hand fractures. These targeted strikes allow fighters to maximize the impact on their opponents while minimizing the risk of injury to their hands.</p><p>Knuckles Used for Punching The choice of which knuckles to use for punching is a subject of debate among martial artists. There are two main choices: the big two knuckles of the pointer and middle finger or the three smaller knuckles of the middle, ring, and little finger. Some argue that hitting with the big two knuckles reduces the risk of breaking the hand due to their size and alignment with the wrist. Others, however, advocate for hitting with the three smaller knuckles, claiming better force distribution. The debate is ongoing, and there is no definitive answer.</p><p>Techniques from Boxing and Wing Chun Boxing and Wing Chun, a form of martial arts, have their own approaches to punching without gloves. Boxers often punch with gloves, which provide some cushioning and protection for their hands. Wing Chun practitioners, on the other hand, emphasize hitting with the three smaller knuckles to distribute force more effectively. However, it is worth noting that boxers rarely engage in bare-knuckle fights, and Wing Chun punches may be less powerful compared to the strikes in BKFC bouts.</p><p>Palm Strikes as an Alternative In addition to punching with the knuckles, some fighters in BKFC may also utilize palm strikes. Hitting with the palm can offer an alternative technique that reduces the risk of hand injuries. However, it is important to mention that palm strikes are not commonly used in street fights or self-defense situations. They are more prevalent in specific martial arts disciplines that emphasize open-hand strikes.</p><p>BKFC fighters have developed various strategies to minimize the risk of breaking their hands in the intense and high-impact sport of bare-knuckle boxing. These strategies include making a tight fist, targeting specific areas, and using different knuckles for punching. While the debate about which knuckles to use continues among martial artists, fighters adapt their techniques to optimize both power and safety. By employing these techniques and tactics, BKFC fighters can compete in this challenging combat sport while reducing the risk of hand injuries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6hprBllKR6o7fFnGSfoZedwaa%2B0malqKxdl7%2Bmrcpmq6Gdmad6qa3Nnao%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
