He’s 40 minutes late. We have no ramikens, and we have no plates,” immediately set the tone of the song. The lyrics showcase impatience and annoyance towards someone who is responsible for washing dishes and appears to have failed in their duty. The repetition of “we have no plates” emphasizes the frustration of not having the essential kitchenware due to the lack of cleanliness.</p><p>The next lines, “The grease trap is full of shit. You’re gonna clean it, bitch,” intensify the anger and demonstrate a strong power dynamic. The use of derogatory language adds an aggressive and confrontational tone, implying a relationship of authority where the speaker expects the other person to comply with their demands.</p><p>As the song progresses, it further highlights the dissatisfaction with the dishwasher’s performance. Lines like “Oh my god, the water is dirty. Please tell me you’re changing the sanitizer, bitch,” further accentuate the frustration and disgust towards the lack of cleanliness. The repetition of the word “bitch” reinforces the dominance and authority the speaker tries to assert.</p><p>In the chorus section, the lyrics take a more threatening turn. “I will break every dish in the sink on your face, you minimum wage fucking swine,” exhibits an escalation of anger. The speaker threatens violence as a form of retribution for the dishwasher’s perceived incompetence. This aggression and threats serve as an outlet for the frustration and powerlessness felt by the speaker.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Experience_with_%E2%80%9CWashing_Dish%E2%80%9D_by_XEIGHTY-SIXEDx></span>Personal Experience with “Washing Dish” by XEIGHTY-SIXEDx<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Personally, I find “Washing Dish” by XEIGHTY-SIXEDx to be a cathartic expression of pent-up frustrations.
