This means that the role of Tighnari is open and the one who will take over the role has some big shoes to fill due to how fans instantly loved the character during his initial release.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=426 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>In the game, Tighnari is a smart guy. He knows the Sumeru forest so well to the point where people trust him whenever danger. is around. He also knows how to cure the injured or sick while exploring the region. At the same time, he’s also someone who’d defy the Akademiya and is well-trained in combat. He may be a standard five-star character in the game, but he’s very useful to have when exploring Sumeru.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>With that being said, the person who does take over the role needs to be able to emulate his passion and knowledge, as well as his sassy nature. And here are some voice actors who could be strong contenders for the role.</p><h2 id=h-5-vic-mignogna data-injectable=false>5. Vic Mignogna</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>You might recognize <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vic Mignogna’</a>s voice since he starred in multiple big anime titles, such as Edward Elric in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FullMetal Alchemist</a>, Rin Matsuoka in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Free! Iwatobi Swim Club</a>, and Tamaki in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ouran High School Host Club</a>, just to name a few. He’s a big deal in the anime-dubbing industry and he has the sass to play the intellectual Forest Ranger.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, while he is very talented, it’s unlikely that Hoyoverse would consider hiring him due to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sexual harassment allegations</a>. Not to mention, the anime community is divided if the voice actor is guilty or innocent. Regardless, his talent is still recognizable by anime dub fans.</p><h2 id=h-4-jim-parsons data-injectable=false>4. Jim Parsons</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Bang Theory</a>&nbsp;star&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jim Parsons</a>&nbsp;has the same vocal range as Tighnari. Not to mention, he may be able to pull off the same sass level needed for the role. One of the main reasons people like this five-star forest ranger character is because he’s smart, friendly, and can talk smack to the Akademiya. And knowing the past roles Parson has done in the past, he is the perfect person to emulate Tighnari’s personality.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>The only issue would be that he may be too expensive to cast. Sure, Hoyoverse earned $1.7 billion in 2022 thanks to&nbsp;Genshin Impact&nbsp;profits alone. But this is a recurring role, and Parsons may either be too busy to record some lines or to even take the role at all.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. Ben Schwartz</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=652 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>Wouldn’t it be interesting to hear <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> voice actor Ben Schwarts voice Tighnari? Sure, he’s done multiple voice work in TV and is also an actor. But having someone like him, known to voice characters in children’s TV, play a role in a gacha video game would be a funny sight to see since it’s a different genre. While he doesn’t have plenty of experience voicing characters in video games, it would be an interesting choice if Hoyoverse does choose him. Also, picking him could spark some sort of reaction from Sonic fans, especially due to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hostile relationship both fans had during the 2022 Game Awards.</a></p><h2 id=h-2-bryce-papenbrook data-injectable=false>2. Bryce Papenbrook</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=646 data-current-count=946 data-injectable=true>Another worthy candidate to be Tighnari’s newest voice actor is Bryce Papenbrook, the voice behind Adrien in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Miraculous Ladybug</a>, Eren Yeager in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Attack on Titan</a>, and Kirito in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sword Art Online</a>. He has the vocal range to play a variety of characters, friendly or hostile, and this is good, considering that Tighnari is both chilled-out and aggressive when he needs to be. He’s also a notable name in the voice-acting industry, so having him in the game should be worth it. Especially if Hoyoverse wants to completely separate Tighnari from his previous voice actor, and encourage fans to try to aim for him in the standard gacha banner.</p><h2 id=h-1-sungwon-cho data-injectable=false>1. <strong>SungWon Cho</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true>Fun fact, SungWon Cho had multiple minor voice roles in Genshin Impact. He played Krosl, the Snezhnayan merchant, Uncle Dai from Liyue, and Bravo the Miner. Another fun fact, main voice actors like Zach Aguilar, can play both leading and minor roles. So there is an opportunity here to give one of the internet’s most beloved voice actors a five-star character role.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>Aside from Genshin Impact, Cho voiced in different video games, like Boyfriend Dungeon, God of War: Ragnarök, and&nbsp;Borderlands 3. And let’s not forget the variety of TV roles he’s received as well. So in the end, he has a full list of experiences and credentials to become the next voice for Tighnari.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>And if Hoyoverse wants a safety net, it should know that Cho can’t be problematic because if he did, he’s going to break plenty of hearts who love him for his YouTube content, alongside his voice-acting work.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>At the moment, it’s currently unknown who would replace Gindi and play the role of this 5-star character. However, it’s good to know that there are qualified voice actors out there who could do the job. It’s up to Hoyoverse to find the right one who it believes could do the role justice, as well as help separate the character from its previous voice actor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZobGaun56wpnnAnKuoqqNixKm7jJyYp2Wimr2trcKeZJ6knJ68tXnGoqWdoV2Wu6V5z6WYsmWknrSpusCroGahnmK0prrSoaCnZZmivaKv02g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
