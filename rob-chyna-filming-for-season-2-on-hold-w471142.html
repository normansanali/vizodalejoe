They patched things up less than 48 hours later.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite the on-off relationship, <a href=#>the formerly reclusive reality star is in “a really positive mood again,”</a> a source previously told <i>Us</i>. “Everything was moving so fast with the relationship, the baby, the engagement and the show that this break has been really good for both of them,” the insider added.&nbsp;</p><span class=caption></span><p>This week, Rob and his daughter have been <a href=#>spending time with the rest of the Kardashian clan</a>.
