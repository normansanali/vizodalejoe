West has since released nine more studio albums, including Donda in 2021. West has racked up 24 Grammy Award wins through the years.</p><p>After expressing an interest in fashion early on in his career, West premiered his women’s fashion line, DW by Kanye West, at Paris Fashion Week in 2011. The launch of his Yeezy Season 1 line, which he created in collaboration with Adidas in early 2015, helped cement his place in the industry. Season 2 dropped later that year and Season 3 debuted in February 2016.</p><p>West is no stranger to sparking controversy. He has publicly feuded with many celebrities, including <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, who he famously interrupted during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. In December 2022, West was suspended from Twitter (now X) after posting antisemitic content, which led to Adidas and other major brands to cut ties with the rapper.</p><p>West married <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> in 2014. The pair share four children: daughter <a href=#>North</a> (born in June 2013), son <a href=#>Saint</a> (born in December 2015), daughter <a href=#>Chicago</a> (born in January 2018, via surrogate) and son <a href=#>Psalm</a> (born May 2019, via surrogate). After nearly seven years of marriage, Kim filed for divorce in February 2021. The proceedings were finalized in November 2022.</p><p>Us confirmed in June 2021 that West was dating model <a href=#><strong>Irina Shayk</strong></a>, but the pair called it quits by August 2021. West briefly dated actress <a href=#><strong>Julia Fox</strong></a> and model <strong>Chaney Jones</strong> in 2022. He later moved on with Yeezy architectural designer <strong>Bianca Censori</strong>. Us confirmed in October 2023 that the two had tied the knot “for religious reasons.”</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnm5a7urGMsJysrF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
