Leading this charge was&nbsp;Josephine Jewell Dodge. Dodge was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1855 to a wealthy and politically-connected family (per <a href=#>Britannica</a>). After marrying a New York businessman and involving herself deeply in issues of progressive social reform, she began to publicly oppose voting for rights for women, as she felt it would threaten what was perceived as the nonpartisan reform work of women.
