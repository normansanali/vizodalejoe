The relay team includes Shericka Jackson, who earlier failed to qualify for 200 meters finals. The Jamaican sprint star earlier won bronze in the women's 100 meters race.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 200 meters race at the , Italian sprinter Dalia Kaddari beat Jackson by four-thousandths of a second -- taking the third and final qualifying position in the heats. Jackson, the third-fastest in the world in this year, finished fourth with a timing of 23.26 seconds.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p>Her error during the sprint caused some shock to commentators. Commentator Steve Cram , “Shericka Jackson was almost just jogging around. What on earth? Why take such risks? I’m sorry to sound exasperated but I am, on her behalf, on her coach’s behalf, and her teammates. It’s just not necessary.” Jamaican sprint coach Stephen Francis said, “She obviously misread, she paid the price. She is not a senior athlete, she is a senior athlete in the 400m and a rookie at the 200m. I expected her to do better. She will learn.”</p><p>“I tell you what, Shericka Jackson was playing that rather dangerously," Martin Gillingham on Eurosport commentary. "She was applying the brakes almost unnecessarily was the bronze medallist from the 100m. She looks fairly unconcerned… She hasn’t actually made the first three.”</p><p>As per a Reuters , the relay team will likely be strengthened by the introduction of Elaine Thompson-Herah, who is widely known as the Sprint Queen, and clocked 21.53 seconds to win gold in 200 meters dash on Tuesday, August 3; and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who took home the silver medal at the 100 meters sprint, clocking 10.74 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in St. Ann, Jamaica on July 16, 1994, Jackson, at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, won bronze in the 400 meters and a silver medal with the 4x400 meters relay team. Jackson also won gold with the 4x400 meters relay team at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing, China, and bronze in the 400m. In August 2019 Jackson won the 400 meters at the Pan Am Games in Lima, Peru.</p><h2 class=split>What is Shericka Jackson’s net worth?</h2><p>The sprinter’s net worth varies depending on different websites. One report says that she has a net worth that varies between $1 million and $5 million. Another website reported that her net worth varies between $1 million and $3 million.</p><p>While there is no information about what her salary is, Jackson was signed by Puma in January 2017 -- alongside Christania Williams, Megan Simmond, Janieve Russell, Rusheen McDonald, Julian Forte, and O’Dayne Richards.</p><p>At the time, Pascal Rolling, Head of Sports Marketing Running for Puma , “Usain is irreplaceable. But most of the fastest athletes come from the Caribbean and the most successful country among them is Jamaica. These athletes will represent our brand in the coming World Championships next August and because they are young, certainly until the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq5iav6qvyppko5mToMCwuoynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMo5immZmYrq95wK2fpZ2kmnpyfI9mpGaqlaGuunnFoqWapKNisqK%2By6Kcq2WWlratscNmq6hloaqurbXFsmSfp6Jif3F8jKZkbmxkaoR3</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
