Thanks to his mother who was very supportive towards Toure, he managed to break out from his generation, which already had legal problems before their 18th birthday. He went to George Washington High School in Los Angeles, California, and after matriculation enrolled at California State University, Northridge, wanting to become a child psychologist. He started writing, also turning towards religion, and as early as 2002 founded his own church.
