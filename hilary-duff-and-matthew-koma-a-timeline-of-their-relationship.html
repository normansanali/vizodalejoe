They’re also one of the most relatable, thanks to their social media posts about <a href=#>scrolling through Postmates</a> in bed, <a href=#>NSFW tattoos</a> and just being happy they found one another.</p><p>“I will always choose sandwiches and 8 p.m. bedtimes over fancy date nights …. over and over again,” Duff wrote via Instagram on the <a href=#>first anniversary of their 2019 engagement</a>. “My best friend, lover, and papa bear that can not be rivaled… it’s always been you.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Younger</a> alum met the record producer after collaborating together on her 2015 album Breathe In. Breathe Out. One year prior, Duff split from her ex-husband, NHL player <a href=#><strong>Mike Comrie</strong></a>, with whom she <a href=#>shares son <strong>Luca</strong></a>.</p><p>“They had great chemistry in the studio,” a source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> of Koma and his now-wife at the time. “Hilary thinks Matt is very talented and cute.”</p><p>However, it wasn’t until 2017 — one year after they officially started dating — that the <a href=#>former Disney Channel star</a> and the Winnetka Bowling League band leader made their red carpet debut. The twosome welcomed their <a href=#>first daughter, <strong>Banks</strong></a>, in October 2018. The following year, they tied the knot during an intimate backyard ceremony that incorporated their kids, who are “obviously, the biggest part of our life,” Duff told Vogue in 2019.</p><p>Amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the <a href=#>A Cinderella Story</a> actress announced that she was <a href=#>pregnant with her third child</a>. “Lol quarantine was fun,” the “So Yesterday” singer joked via Instagram that October.</p><p>In March 2021, Duff gave birth to the pair’s <a href=#>second daughter, <strong>Mae James</strong></a>, and praised her husband for his support during her at-home water birth. “My hubby is the most calm anchor in the room when I feel like climbing the walls,” Duff wrote via Instagram in celebration of <a href=#>Mae’s 4-month “birth day.”</a></p><p>Raising three kids isn’t easy, but the couple have a sense of humor about keeping their romance alive when they aren’t changing diapers. In September 2021, <a href=#>Koma praised Duff</a> for balancing her parenting duties while filming <a href=#>Hulu’s How I Met Your Father</a>, sharing a photo that he described as “one of my favorite pictures of wifey somewhere between supremely fulfilled, exhausted and why the f–k are you taking my photo.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She joked in the Instagram comments at that time, “This is bound to get him baby No. 4.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for Duff and Koma’s major relationship milestones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktaq4wKuwZpylm7Nurc2dZKaZpKm1psOMpKammV2WerW1zJ6joqaVYrynedOhnKKqXaeyra3Toqanq5ievXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
