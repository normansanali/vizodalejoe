However, they only&nbsp;went on a few dates, and the last time they saw each other was two days before she was killed.</p><p dir=ltr>On Saturday, April 11, 1981, Sheila Sharp spent the night with neighbors, as she planned to attend church with them the following morning. However, she forgot to bring the clothes she planned to wear to church. As reported by Keddie28, she returned to her family's cabin, which was only 15 feet away, at approximately 7:45 Sunday morning to get her outfit. When she opened the door, Sharp was horrified to find the bodies of her mother, brother John, and her brother's friend, Dana Wingate, covered in blood on the floor of the front room. Keddie28 reported Sharp immediately fled the cabin and ran to the neighbors for help.</p><p dir=ltr>Authorities arrived at the scene shortly after 8 a.m. In addition to confirming Sue, John, and Dana were dead, the officers concluded they were murdered. In one of the bedrooms, authorities found Rick, Greg, and their friend Justin Eason Smartt, unharmed. However, Tina was missing.</p><p dir=ltr>As reported by Keddie28, all three victims were bound with cords, medical tape, and wire. According to <a href=#>Historic Mysteries</a>, John and Sue suffered blunt force trauma to the head and were stabbed multiple times. Although Dana also suffered trauma to the head, she was strangled to death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCClmxpbGtfqbWmecyyqq2doq56o7HHoqWdZaSdsm63xJ2bop1dmK6jtc1mpK6qlJq%2FtHnEsaelmZmjsqV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
