Unfortunately, his tragic passing in October 2023 coincided with the birthday of his former flame and Hollywood luminary, <strong><a href=#>Julia Roberts</a></strong>. Perry and Roberts dated during the mid-1990s, and their relationship blossomed while they worked together on the set of Friends.</p><p><a href=#>Perry became brutally honest about his addiction and substance abuse issues</a> in his memoir Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing. His journey through sobriety was marked by constant relapses, which inevitably cast a shadow over his romantic relationships. Despite trying to conquer his fear of love, Perry could not establish a stable relationship and remained unmarried.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-perry-felt-guilty-about-his-breakup-with-julia-roberts>Matthew Perry Felt Guilty About His Breakup With Julia Roberts</h2><p>Matthew Perry and Julia Roberts became close friends before her guest appearance as Susie Moss in the second season of Friends.

Despite their undeniable chemistry, he confessed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the pressure of dating Roberts became overwhelming</a>.</p><p>He consistently felt a sense of impending breakup from her and believed that Roberts was settling by being in a relationship with him. He reasoned that he was inadequate, unable to measure up, and deemed himself as damaged and unlovable.</p><p>"... So instead of facing the inevitable agony of losing her, I broke up with the beautiful and brilliant Julia Roberts."</p><p>However, in a resurfaced video, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perry gave a different answer</a> when asked about the reason behind his split from Roberts. The actor clarified that their careers were skyrocketing, and finding time to be together became a challenge, so they amicably decided to part ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"...

And she said yes," he recalled.</p><p>Perry did not name his ex, but he admitted to being taken aback while he pondered on how he ended up in such a situation.
