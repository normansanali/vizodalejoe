The show, which has been a huge hit on Netflix, centers around three best friends Maddie, Helen, and Dana Sue who are born and raised in Serenity, SC, a small southern town where everybody knows everybody and everybody knows everybody’s business.&nbsp;</p><p id=e4h6v9nIoTH data-wc=44>So what can we expect from season 3? The official synopsis reads: "Following the brawl at Sullivan's, Maddie wrestles with the best way to help Cal and works to clear her own emotional path. Helen faces difficult decisions about the men in her life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/67ef8911e3c8-sweetmagnoliasns3e200300003rc.jpg><p id=euJk8HMTI6T data-wc=75>"And Dana Sue searches for a way to use Miss Frances' check to help the community, without upending her family. The identity of the tire slasher sends shockwaves through Serenity, the recall causes unexpected consequences, and there are romantic surprises in every generation. Throughout the season, the ladies tackle these problems -- and all the complications they cause - with their trademark warmth, humor, and devotion to each other and those they love. And margaritas."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4655da7aba1c-sweet-magnolias-d.jpg><p id=eW0Uax9Z08Q data-wc=11><strong>What are you waiting for?

There's a lot of love and romance, and you're going to get to see a deeper side of our friendship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0e799f062857-sweetmagnoliasns3e200312110rc.jpg><p id=eERpv8YjRK7V data-wc=44>"For my character, you start to see a little bit more self-reflection. She's coming out of that dark cloud of divorce and seeing where she's landing. Towards the end, you start to see that there is a glimmer of what's to come for Maddie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3c5af5854e30-sweet-magnolias-joanna-update-d.jpg><p id=eVNO_8QnL7so data-wc=63>"It was a really rewarding season because I feel like it was pedal to the metal for the first two seasons with all the things that were coming at Maddie, and this year and this season, she got an opportunity to reflect and become a better friend and a different person and grow a little bit. It was a special season for me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e183e6d14baa-joanne-garcia-sweet-magnolias.jpg><p id=ewso0xLbl9-K data-wc=82>She continued: "This season, you're going to see a deeper side of their friendship. It's not always rainbows and butterflies, and sometimes there's some cloudy days. That's an important element and something that's really real, and I think it was about time that we honored that. You start to see how they struggle through life together, with each other, with other people, and it's a tribute to strong female friendships. ... This is a really relatable show. I'm so proud of it."&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
