For example, you might be Fred the Nurse or Agnes the Firefighter. Likewise, Greek deities must have been Fred the God of Cookies, or Agnes the Goddess of Having Your Nose in a Smartphone All the Time. But it was actually not that simple.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Springhole.net</a>, most Greek deities played multiple roles. We already know that&nbsp;<a href=#>Poseidon</a>&nbsp;had something to do with earthquakes and horses but was also the god of the sea, and apparently we also get to blame him for the fact that it hardly ever rains in California anymore. And there was also Hermes, who not only had to run around with the gods' stupid notes (because Agnes the Goddess of Having Your Nose in a Smartphone All the Time hadn't joined the Olympians yet) but was also the god of commerce, athletes, travelers, cattle, writing, giving speeches, telling stupid jokes, being nice to visitors, stealing stuff, oh and astrology. Also, he had to ferry departed souls to the underworld. He did have those shoes with the wings on them, so that was a perk.</p><p>So you can't really definitively say that all gods were gods of one thing or another, but you can say that they were pretty seriously overworked, which explains why they were so ill-tempered all the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kGtqaXFfm66tv8Rmq6GhnpzAbsXOrq2eZZKauaqx1aKloGWXp7Kmt4ymsK2gn6G8qMWO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
