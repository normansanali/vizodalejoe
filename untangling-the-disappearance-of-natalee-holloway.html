According to Holloway family attorney John Kelly, a desperate&nbsp;Joran emailed him&nbsp;that&nbsp;March, writing, as Kelly told Dateline,&nbsp;"'I want to come clean. My father's dead now. I have nothing to hide. I want to help Natalee's family, but at a price, you know, for a quarter million dollars...I will tell you what happened to Natalee, where she is now so you can help Beth bring her home.'"</p><p>With Beth's permission,&nbsp;John Kelly&nbsp;met with&nbsp;Joran in Aruba, promising to start with $25,000. The young man said he knew where the body was;&nbsp;John asked what would happen if they didn't pay him.&nbsp;Joran allegedly replied, "'Beth can wait another five years.'"&nbsp;The family then turned to the FBI, which helped orchestrate a plan to make&nbsp;Joran think he'd be getting paid in order to catch him committing wire fraud, which would at least be something to hold him on.</p><p>John&nbsp;and Joran met again, and this time&nbsp;John wired&nbsp;him a total of $25,000. In turn,&nbsp;Joran led&nbsp;John&nbsp;to a house near the Aruba Racquet Club,&nbsp;where he claimed he had stashed&nbsp;Natalee's remains in what was then a freshly poured foundation, before the house was built.&nbsp;John&nbsp;<a href=#>said on&nbsp;Dateline</a> that Joran claimed he had been on the beach with Natalee, he wanted to go, she resisted, and then he "got angry and actually threw her. He actually made the gesture in the car, on video, showing me how he threw her in anger, because she wouldn't leave at that point. And according to him, she hit the back of her head, lots of blood and she was dead."</p><p>John&nbsp;said he was skeptical of&nbsp;Joran's overall story, which was that he first hid Natalee's body at the beach with his father's help, and then the next day they buried her.&nbsp;But he still hoped they had shaken something loose.</p><p>"When I got on the plane May 11 [2010], I thought it was a done deal," John&nbsp;said. "And he was going to be arrested at some point. That he'd be talking at some point, and we'd get some closure at some point."</p><p>But the house Joran pointed to hadn't been under construction in 2010, according to the authorities who&nbsp;said they didn't find his story credible enough to make an arrest.</p><p>John&nbsp;said that&nbsp;Joran remained in touch with him up until May 25, claiming he would turn himself in. Instead, he flew to Peru.</p><p>A federal grand jury <a href=#>indicted him</a> on charges of wire fraud and extortion on June 30, 2010.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prvNpaCnnV6YvK57z6GmraejZH95fJdrZq6mpJa7qLjIp55mrJiaeqW10pqnqZ2Rp66vr8Rmpp9lnpbBorjEnmShp5yhvLit2A%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
