If there is any footage or photos taken backstage at the WWE Performance Center, it was taken last week. Orange County is still in a stay at home order and so is the entire state of Florida.</p><p>It seems like Sasha Banks might have accidentally given something away. She uploaded an image on Instagram, and then she quickly deleted it.</p><p>Her nails match the style she had in photos taken last week and we’ve never seen that ring gear either. Another interesting thing to note is that The Boss is holding the SmackDown Women’s Title in that photo.</p><p>Sasha Banks is wrestling for the SmackDown Women’s Title during the second night of WrestleMania 36. Her best friend Bayley is the champion and she will have Lacey Evans, Tamina, and Naomi to deal with as well.</p><p>This photo was quickly deleted, but it was sent in to us by one of our awesome readers. This is certainly interesting timing to be posting a photo and then deleting it. Banks also knows how the game is played and we’re sure Bayley would let her borrow the belt for a minute so she can play a little pre-WrestleMania prank on the internet.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><figure class=wp-block-image></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
